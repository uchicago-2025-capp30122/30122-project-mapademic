        "Abstract": "Stock price prediction is an important topic for investors and companies. The increasing effect of machine learning methods in every field also applies to stock forecasting. In this study, it is aimed to predict the future prices of the stocks of companies in different sectors traded on the Borsa Istanbul (BIST) 30 Index. For the study, the data of two companies selected as examples from each of the holding, white goods, petrochemical, iron and steel, transportation and communication sectors were analyzed. In the study, in addition to the share analysis of the sectors, the price prediction performances of the machine learning algorithm on a sectoral basis were examined. For these tests, XGBoost, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms were used. The obtained results were analyzed with mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percent error (MAPE), mean squared error (MSE), and R2 correlation metrics. The best estimations on a sectoral basis were made for companies in the Iron and Steel and Petroleum field. One of the most important innovations in the study is the examination of the effect of current macro changes on the forecasting model. As an example, the effect of the changes in the Central Bank Governors, which took place three times in the 5-year period, on the forecast was investigated. The results showed that the unpredictable effects on the policies after the change of Governors also negatively affected the forecast performance.",

        "Abstract": "The latest advances in technology and the improvement of decision processes with learning methods based on artificial intelligence have put the word \"intelligent\" ahead of all systems that make human life easier. Based on intelligent transportation systems, it is aimed to reduce the damage to the country’s economy and the environment while providing technology-based and faster, safer, more accessible, more sustainable and more efficient transportation. The main goal of creating the intelligent transportation systems architecture is to design and implement human-focused, sustainable transportation systems together with cutting-edge technologies such as industry 4.0 technologies, mobile applications, augmented reality, and the internet of things. Intelligent transportation systems architecture needs to be updated according to C-ITS systems that provide interoperability and data integrity. Therefore, the main factor in creating the architecture of intelligent transport systems is to create system architecture by making complex systems with data integrity and numerous insignificant idle data into systems that communicate with each other and reach the level of interoperability. In this study, intelligent transportation systems policies in the world have been analyzed and systems that have reached the level of interoperability that will provide the basis of C-ITS and intelligent transportation system architecture have been proposed.",

        "Abstract": "Understanding the impact of input variables on black-box machine learning and deep learning models is necessary. Therefore, this study proposed SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values to address the problem of the interpretability of the output of the support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), convolutional neural network (CNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) models to forecast climatic water balance (CWB) within 1–3 months lead-time. The current study uses two Koppen–Geiger climate zones over Bangladesh: the humid subtropical climate with dry winter and hot summer (Cwa) and the tropical climate (Af-Am). Monthly antecedent CWB, potential evapotranspiration (PET), convective available potential energy (CAPE), relative humidity (RH), air temperature (TEM), El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), and North Atlantic oscillation (NAO) are used as the inputs to the proposed model. SHAP values show that CWB (current month) for both climate zones has the maximum impact on the prediction. The effects of atmospheric variables and ocean–atmospheric teleconnections on CWB forecasts over Bangladesh are low. Forecasting results show that the SVM model shows the best performance for CWB forecasts in the Cwa and Af-Am climate zones in terms of antecedent CWB as input. And this model effectively decreases the negative effect of increasing forecast lead-time. Since the proposed model can predict CWB in 3-months lead-time, it would help policy-makers and practitioners to reduce the drought and flood impacts in the future by adopting better preparedness plans.",

In this work, we present an effective di- agnosis and monitoring system for the early detection of the mechanical degra- dation in such components, also capable of providing insights on the damage's causes. The classification task is performed by an ensemble of two learners: a convolutional autoencoder and a distance&density-based unsupervised classifier that use as regressors specific Health Indexes (HIs) and flight parameters. The proposed approach employs the autoencoder reconstruction error information to infer the most probable cause of each detected fault, and enacts post-processing filtering policies that effectively reduce the number of false alarms. Extensive experimental validation witnesses the good performances and the robustness of the proposed approach.",

        "Abstract": "The large-scale deployment of intelligent Internet of things (IoT) devices have brought increasing needs for computation support in wireless access networks. Applying machine learning (ML) algorithms at the network edge, i.e., edge learning, requires efficient training, in order to adapt themselves to the varying environment. However, the transmission of the training data collected by devices requires huge wireless resources. To address this issue, we exploit the fact that data samples have different importance for training, and use an influence function to represent the importance. Based on the importance metric, we propose a data pre-processing scheme combining data filtering that reduces the size of dataset and data compression that removes redundant information. As a result, the number of data samples as well as the size of every data sample to be transmitted can be substantially reduced while keeping the training accuracy. Furthermore, we propose device scheduling policies, including rate-based and Monte-Carlo-based policies, for multi-device multi-channel systems, maximizing the summation of data importance of scheduled devices. Experiments show that the proposed device scheduling policies bring more than 2% improvement in training accuracy.",

        "Abstract": "Industrial symbiosis is widely sought for industrial sustainability in recent years. While multiple factors are identified important for industrial symbiosis occurrence, the complex interactions among these factors and the emergence mechanisms of industrial symbiotic relationships (SR) remain not well explored in the literature, especially not with empirical data. In this study, we aim to address this knowledge gap based on machine learning and first-hand data collected from a survey of 201 enterprises in Chun'an County, Zhejiang Province, China. The mechanisms behind these symbiotic relationships were explored by simulating the interactions and nonlinear effects of 37 selected factors categorized into sociopolitical, economic, and technological dimensions. We found that the sociopolitical dimension factors (particularly the enterprises' demand for cleaner production and the indirect influence from similar environmental protection behaviors of other enterprises) play the most important role behind industrial SR establishment. Imperfect regulations or lack of legal basis, the scale of economy for SR participation, and the varying quality of reused raw materials or products are identified as key obstacles. Our multidimensional analysis revealed non-linear effects suggests that such a system understanding on influencing factors and the emergence mechanism of industrial SR is necessary and important to formulate relevant policy for boosting industrial symbiosis and thus industrial sustainability.",

        "Abstract": "The increasing severity of climate change has posed a great challenge to smallholders' livelihoods. In addition to smallholders' autonomous adaptations, policy-makers need to consider how to make sound government interventions to help smallholders effectively adapt to climate change. This study aims to explore how smallholders adapt to climate change under government interventions, and in turn provide recommendations for the government to better promote smallholder adaptation. To achieve this purpose, 1552 household survey data were collected in four agro-pastoral regions of the Tibetan Plateau (TP). A machine learning approach (boosted regression tree, BRT) was used to explore the factors influencing the adaption strategies of smallholders to climate change, especially the role of government interventions in this process. The results show that the smallholders mainly adopted four adaptation strategies (off-home activities, nature reclaiming farmland, raising more livestock, and crop management), while local governments helped them by providing subsidies, training, credit, insurance, and improved varieties; building roads and irrigation facilities; and organizing cooperatives. The results of the BRT model show that the natural capital indicators (elevation, farmland area) were still important factors influencing the smallholders' adoption of adaptation strategies, because natural capital reflects the livelihood basis of smallholders to some extent. The results also suggest that government interventions such as subsidies, cooperatives, and training played an important role in this process. Based on these results, we propose targeted policy recommendations to help local governments improve existing government interventions and to provide lessons for governments in other regions or countries to plan government interventions to promote smallholder adaptation.",

Limited economic access for households to obtain sufficient food can cause food insecurity. The social protection program is a policy that plays an important role in efforts to fulfil economic access for households to reduce the incidence of food insecurity. A study about the contribution of social protection programs to food insecurity events needs to be carried out. One of the machine learning methods, namely classification tree can be applied to achieve this goal. The data used in this study is from the 2020 Indonesian Social Economic Survey (SUSENAS) in Aceh Province which consists of food insecurity status as an output variable and 7 input variables; PKH, KKS, BPNT, Local Government Assistance, BPJS, Jamkesda, and PIP. The results obtained are that BPJS provides the largest contribution in determining the status of food insecurity with an AUC value of 0.60.",

        "Abstract": "Manual sizing of analog circuit specifications has become challenging owing to their ever-increasing complexity. Especially for innovative, large-scale circuit designs with numerous design variables, operating conditions, and conflicting objectives to optimize, analog designers must run time-consuming simulations for several weeks to find the optimum configuration. Recently, machine learning and optimization techniques have been applied in the field of analog circuit design, wherein evolutionary algorithms and Bayesian models have shown good results for circuit sizing tasks. In this context, we introduce multi-objective optimization based on differential evolution and Bayesian inference (MODEBI)—a design optimization method based on generalized differential evolution 3 (GDE3) and Gaussian processes (GPs). The proposed method can perform sizing for complex circuits that require optimization of many design variables and conflicting objectives. Although state-of-the-art methods reduce multi-objective problems to single-objective optimization and potentially induce a priori bias, the proposed method searches directly over the multi-objective space using Pareto dominance and ensures that designers are provided with diverse solutions to choose from. To reduce optimization time, we propose using GPs to model the circuit and employing this surrogate model to preselect candidates. However, this results in a more complex offspring selection process, and the diversity in population survival must be specifically addressed. This paper proposes several solutions to these problems, resulting in multiple MODEBI variations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method that specifically addresses solution diversity and simultaneously focuses on minimizing the number of simulations required to obtain feasible configurations. The evaluation performed on two voltage regulators with different complexity levels showed that the proposed offspring selection method and survival policy can obtain highly diverse feasible solutions considerably faster than GDE3 or Bayesian optimization-based algorithms.",

        "Abstract": "India is an agrarian economy and largest share of population depend on agriculture. Though there are mechanisms to approximately estimate crop yield by means of controlled experiments or past data, the reliability is limited. As a matter of fact, the crop yield is based on estimates that may suffer from multiple bias. In recent years, remote sensing images augmented with machine learning and deep learning techniques help us get the efficient crop yield statistics based on the crop on the field which help policymakers in devising better policies and governance. Remote sensing images of crops under study when subjected to machine learning techniques, one can classify the images into homogenous crop classes and record crop health / growth indicators such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Soil Adjusted Vegetative Index (SAVI) based on the training dataset and image quality, which further leads to crop yield estimates with desired level of accuracy. The present study investigates the relationship between yield influencing parameters such as physical variables, soil, weather characteristics and vegetation indices. Using correlation and multiple regression analysis, most efficient parameters that best estimate the crop yield is determined using the satellite data obtained for a study region in central part of the state of Karnataka. It was found that one of the vegetation indices, Soil Adjusted Vegetative Index values can predict near to accurate crop yield values by the end of 81 days after transplantation of paddy where as NDVI and NDVI can give yield estimated only after 116 days of transplantation. Thus crop yield estimates using SAVI works better in terms of predicting paddy yield at least one month before (after 81 days of transplantation) actual harvesting i.e., after 120 days as practiced by farmers in the study area.",

        "Abstract": "Water-energy nexus studies aim to connect the process of power generation with the corresponding water demand. The lack of information on the currently installed cooling systems at individual power plants is a challenge for the assessment of the water use on the power plant-level, which complicates decision-making in water management, especially in water-stressed regions. In this study, we investigate the spatial and temporal trends in cooling technology installations globally. Based on that, we propose a machine learning model for cooling technology identification on a regional and global level, which uses a combination of feature selection and classification algorithms. The global model demonstrates an average test set accuracy of 85.42%, which corresponds to only a minor underestimation of the actual global water footprint of 1.78% when the cooling technology and water footprint of individual power plant units is unknown. Apart from that, a special emphasis was placed on regions characterized by high and extremely high water stress, where mistakes in water policy planning and water management may lead to an unsustainable water use or even to an overexploitation of water resources. In these regions, the calculated test set accuracy was 80.83%, which is significantly larger than the average accuracy of a majority class model. The results and the method proposed in this study enable cooling system identification in individual power units using information available from other sources, such as the water stress score or seasonal freshwater availability in the region.",

        "Abstract": "The spatial feature of building energy consumption in a city is essential for urban level energy planning and policy making. With the increasing availability of urban level building energy benchmarking datasets, machine learning has shown a powerful capability of making data-driven predictions on urban level building energy consumption. However, the building energy benchmarking datasets usually only cover large buildings, which are not sufficient representations of all buildings in a city. Besides building energy benchmarking datasets, many other urban level open datasets are also valuable to building energy prediction, but they do not contain building energy use data, in other words, they are unlabeled. This study proposes a novel framework based on semi-supervised learning to make effective use of the unlabeled datasets to develop more generic urban level data-driven building energy prediction models, and energy mapping with higher space resolution. The framework consists of preliminary labeling, selection of pseudo labeled samples and predictive modelling. Several machine learning algorithms are proposed and compared for generating pseudo labels of building electricity consumption for unlabeled datasets of small and medium-sized buildings. A selection process consisting of convergence testing and screening is designed to select pseudo labeled samples with high credibility to enlarge the labeled dataset. A novel two-level performance evaluation method is proposed to evaluate the performance of the framework at both urban level and district level to enhance the spatial resolution of the predictions. The framework is implemented to model and map the individual electricity consumptions of all buildings in two years in the districts of New York City using multiple open datasets. The results show significant improvement in terms of prediction accuracy at both levels. In addition, the applicability of the model to various buildings in the city is remarkably enhanced.",

        "Abstract": "The trend of zero-carbonization has accelerated the prevalence of electric vehicles (EVs) owing to their advantages of low carbon emissions and high energy efficiency. The stochastic and high charging load of EVs results in a non-negligible challenge that may cause grid overload. A promising approach is the participation of charging stations in demand response as load aggregators by coordinating the charging power of electric vehicles. However, improper coordination of charging load may lead to unfulfilled charging demand, which would cause dissatisfaction on the demand side. In this study, the incentive-based and time-varying demand response mechanism is considered when charging stations coordinate charging of multiple EVs. A decentralized decision-making framework is innovatively applied to provide charging power of each EV. The charging process is modeled as a Markov decision process, and a virtual price is designed to help decide the charging power. Deep reinforcement learning algorithms such as deep deterministic policy gradient are applied to determine the charging strategy of multiple and heterogeneous EVs. Numerical experiments are performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. A comparison with an optimal charging strategy and a heuristic rule-based method shows that the proposed method can trade off the revenue from demand response and user satisfaction, as well as reduce the peak load of the charging station. Furthermore, a test with inaccurate departure information indicates the robustness of the proposed method.",

        "Abstract": "Ground-level ozone is an important pollutant regarding air quality and climate. Mexico City frequently experiences severe ozone episodes due to a combination of strong ozone precursor emissions and its specific topographical environment which critically impacts meteorological conditions. High ozone levels during these episodes cause harmful effects to the public health and the environment. This necessitates ranking air quality and meteorological variables according to their contributions towards the build-up of ozone. In this study, three machine learning models are used to learn a prediction function with hourly data of eight predictors as input and hourly ground-level ozone mixing ratios as output. One-year hourly data of eight predictors collected in Mexico-City from March 2015 to February 2016 is employed to train and test the models. The best model, capturing ozone peak levels with 92% accuracy during 6–18 March 2016, is used to rank the predictors according to their importance in the build-up of ozone applying a shapley additive explanations approach based on the game theory shapley values. This 6–18 March 2016 period encompassed different meteorological and emission conditions and included a severe ozone smog episode from 12 to 17 March 2016. Such ranking of the air quality and meteorological variables is crucial for policy-making decisions regarding the prevention and mitigation of ozone detrimental effects during severe ozone episodes and provides insight into the functional dependency of ozone on its predictors. The proposed approach showcases Mexico City, but its principles can be applied for ozone episodes at any other location.",

        "Abstract": "It is a well-established fact that energy consumption and production, as the primary sources of greenhouse gases, contribute to climate change and global warming issues. The analysis and estimation of the factors that contribute to these harmful gases will be of great assistance in the development of policies to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. In addition to identifying the factors related to energy consumption and CO2 emissions, forecasting the variable of interest as accurately as possible has a key role in increasing the efficiency of energy strategies to be implemented. Unlike studies in the literature, this study not only forecasts the future value of energy consumption and CO2 emissions but also determines the relationship between the predictions and the influential variables by revealing the contribution of each variable to the prediction. For this purpose, the study proposes an interpretable forecasting framework based on values of the Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) to provide a simpler explanation of machine learning (ML) models in forecasting energy consumption and CO2 emissions. The results obtained show that the total electricity generation from different energy sources is found to be the most important variable interacting positively with both energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Also, the influence of the predictors on projections made before and after COVID-19 has changed dramatically. The proposed method may assist policymakers in making future energy investments and establishing energy laws more accurately and efficiently as it explains the drivers of the forecasts.",

In this study, we applied a machine-learning-based simulation model incorporating full-coverage satellite-driven PM2.5 dataset to estimate high-resolution ground PM2.5 concentration for the Golden Triangle of Southern Fujian Province, China (GTSF) in 2030 under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). Based on the simulation output, the ecological risk's spatiotemporal change and the risk for different land cover types, which were caused by PM2.5 pollution, were assessed. We found that the PM2.5 levels and ecological risk in the GTSF under RCP 4.5 would be reduced while those under RCP 8.5 would continue to increase. The regions with the highest ecological risk under RCP 4.5 are the most urbanized and industrialized districts, while those with the highest ecological risk under RCP 8.5 are of the highest rate in urbanization and the greatest decrease in planetary potential layer height. For both base years and 2030 under two RCPs, the ecological risk on developed land is the highest, while that on the forest is the lowest.

        "Abstract": "Considering the dynamically changing nature of the radio propagation environment, the envisioned battery lifetime of the end device (ED) for massive machine-type communication (mMTC) stands for a critical challenge. As the selected radio technology bounds the battery lifetime, the possibility of choosing among several low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) technologies integrated at a single ED may dramatically improve its lifetime. In this article, we propose a novel approach of battery lifetime extension utilizing reinforcement learning (RL) policies. Notably, the system assesses the radio environment conditions and assigns the appropriate rewards to minimize the overall power consumption and increase reliability. To this aim, we carry out extensive propagation and power measurements campaigns at the city-scale level and then utilize these results for composing real-life use cases for static and mobile deployments. Our numerical results show that RL-based techniques allow for a noticeable increase in EDs' battery lifetime when operating in the multi-RAT mode. Furthermore, out of all considered schemes, the performance of the weighted average policy shows the most consistent results for both considered deployments. Specifically, all RL policies can achieve 90% of their maximum gain during the initialization phase for the stationary EDs while utilizing less than 50 messages. Considering the mobile deployment, the improvements in battery lifetime could reach 200%.",

        "Abstract": "To deal with increasing amounts of data, decision and policymakers frequently turn to advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence to capitalise on the potential reward. But there is also a reluctance to trust black-box models, especially when such models are used to support decisions and policies that affect people directly, like those associated with transport and people's mobility. Recent developments focus on explainable artificial intelligence to bolster models’ trustworthiness. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of an explainable-by-design model, Bayesian Networks, on travel behaviour. The model incorporates various demographic and socioeconomic variables to describe full day activity chains: activity and mode choice, as well as the activity and trip durations. More importantly, this paper shows how the model can be used to provide the most relevant explanation for people's observed travel behaviour. The overall goal is to show that model explanations can be quantified and, therefore, assist policymakers to truly make evidence-based decisions. This goal is achieved through two case studies to explain people's vulnerability as it pertains to their total trip duration.",

        "Abstract": "This article proposes a novel machine-learning-based routing optimization for the multiple reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (M-RIS)-assisted multihop cooperative networks, in which a practical phase model for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) with the amplitude variation based on the corresponding discrete phase shift is considered. We aim to maximize the end-to-end data rate in the proposed network by jointly optimizing the data transmission path, the passive beamforming design of RIS, and transmit power allocation. To tackle this complicated nonconvex problem, we divide it into two subtasks: 1) the passive beamforming design of the RIS and 2) joint routing and power allocation optimization. First, for the passive beamforming design of RIS, we develop a distributed learning algorithm that employs a cascade forward backpropagation network in each relay node to solve the RIS coefficients optimization problem by directly using the optimization target to train the cascade networks. This solution can avoid the curse of dimensionality of traditional reinforcement learning algorithms in the RIS optimization problem. Then, based on the result of RIS optimization, we introduce the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm with the clipping method to find solutions for joint optimization of routing and power allocation via achieving the long-term benefit in the Markov decision process (MDP). Simulation results show that the proposed learning-based scheme can learn from the environment to improve its policy stability and efficiency in the iterative training process for optimizing routing and RIS and significantly outperform the benchmark schemes.",

        "Abstract": "Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) has gained a rising concentration recently. It aims to provide a set of aspect terms and sentiments from a piece of text. Educational Data Mining (EDM) is now an essential tool for analysing pedagogical data. In academic institutions, student feedback is an influential gauge to measure the quality of the teaching–learning process. It helps higher education institutions to reconsider and improve their policies for student recruitment and retention. This paper proposed a situation awareness multi-layer topic modelling and enhanced hybrid machine learning approach for evaluating students’ textual feedback data in academic institutions. The proposed Aspect2Labels (A2L) approach is divided our system into three layers. To preserve semantic information, we extracted general aspects terms in the first layer known as high-level aspects. We pulled low-level aspects terms associated with high-level aspect terms in the second layer and the third layer used for sentiment orientation. We used zero-shot learning, LDA, and different variants of LDA for the aspect extraction process. We performed annotation on unlabelled students’ comments using our proposed A2L approach, and we obtained 91.3% accuracy in this process. We developed and tested novel algorithms for aspect terms mapping to label each aspect term to corresponding feedback. Different machine learning algorithms have been used to classify sentiments according to extracted aspects. We have also proposed and used Variable Global Feature Selection Scheme (VGFSS) and Variable Stopwords Filtering (VSF) to improve the performance of classifiers. We have managed to get 97% and 93% accuracy on the test dataset using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), respectively. We highly suggest that our novel approach of aspect-oriented sentiment analysis could provide adequate understanding to analyse students’ feedback.",

The results indicates that XGBoost model for predicting the renewable energy production capacity reveals the highest feature importance among independent variables is associated with the gas consumption parameter in the case of G7, oil consumption for EU block and GHG emissions for BRICS, respectively. Furthermore, the generalized additive model (GAM) predictions for the EU block reveal the scenario of relatively constant renewable energy capacity if gas consumption increases, while oil consumption increases determine an increase in renewable energy capacity until a kick point, followed by a decrease. The GAM models for G7 revealed the scenario of an upward trend of renewable energy production capacity, as gas consumption increases and renewable energy production capacity decreases while oil consumption increases. In the case of the BRICS geopolitical block, the prediction scenario reveals that, in time, an increase in gas consumption generates an increase in renewable energy production capacity. The PCA emphasizes that renewable energy production capacity and GHG, respectively CO2 emissions, are highly correlated and are integrated into the first component, which explains more than 60% of the variance. The resulting models represent a good prediction capacity and reveal specific peculiarities for each analyzed geopolitical block. The prediction models conclude that the EU economic growth scenario is based on fossil fuel energy sources during the first development stage, followed by a shift to renewable energy sources once it reaches a kick point, during the second development stage. The decrease in renewable energy production capacity when oil consumption increases indicates that fossil fuels are in trend within the G7 economy. In the case of BRICS, it is assumed that gas consumption appears because of increasing the industrial capacity, followed by the increase of economic sustainability, respectively. In addition, the generalized additive models emphasize evolution scenarios with different peculiarities, specific for each analyzed geopolitical block.",

        "Abstract": "The atypical Markov decision processes (MDPs) are decision-making for maximizing the immediate returns in only one state transition. Many complex dynamic problems can be regarded as the atypical MDPs, e.g., football trajectory control, approximations of the compound Poincaré maps, and parameter identification. However, existing deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are designed to maximize long-term returns, causing a waste of computing resources when applied in the atypical MDPs. These existing algorithms are also limited by the estimation error of the value function, leading to a poor policy. To solve such limitations, this paper proposes an immediate-return algorithm for the atypical MDPs with continuous action space by designing an unbiased and low variance target Q-value and a simplified network framework. Then, two examples of atypical MDPs considering the uncertainty are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm, i.e., passing the football to a moving player and chipping the football over the human wall. Compared with the existing deep RL algorithms, such as deep deterministic policy gradient and proximal policy optimization, the proposed algorithm shows significant advantages in learning efficiency, the effective rate of control, and computing resource usage.",

To verify the proposed control strategy, the effectiveness of the algorithm is analyzed with the practical vehicle test data in Shenyang, and compared with the control effect of the particle swarm optimization algorithm. The results show that the proposed deep reinforcement learning EMS can achieve energy-saving effects better than particle swarm optimization-based strategy.

        "Abstract": "On-road vehicle has been a prominent emission source, hence a key target of control for environment, health, and climate concerns. While considerable efforts have been made to investigate criteria pollutants such as adverse gaseous and particulate emissions across the world, there is limited systematic research to characterize on-road carbon emissions, especially as countries strive to set and achieve various climate goals (i.e., carbon neutrality, carbon peaking by a certain year, etc.) through cleaner vehicle technologies such as the latest vehicle emission standard, China VI (2020). This study used the portable emission measurement system (PEMS) to reveal the real-world emissions from two light-duty gasoline vehicles, one meeting the China V standard and the other China VI. The PEMS measurements were performed secondly in urban and suburban areas respectively, and finally yielded 10 h of rich and finely resolved emissions data. In addition of single-factor analysis, this study employed two machine learning models, stepwise regression and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), to investigate the coupling effects among vehicle/traffic parameters and identify driving behavior, engine condition, and external environment as key determining factors that affect vehicular carbon emissions. In particular, engine load percent and engine speed were confirmed to be the most dominant factors affecting vehicular carbon emissions under both China V and China VI standards, explaining ∼60% of variability in carbon emissions. As a result, vehicle specific power (VSP) is derived from vehicle travel parameters and used as a surrogate for carbon emission estimation. The external facility and environmental factors turned out significant as well in affecting vehicle carbon emissions: carbon emissions from the same vehicle were significantly higher in an urban setting then in suburban areas, mostly due to the more aggressive driving patterns in congested urban traffic. Travelling under relatively better traffic conditions on expressways gave the lowest per-distance emission factors of CO2, CO, and NOx. Comparing between the China V and VI vehicle, our PEMS data show significant carbon emission reduction benefits (15.9% in CO2, 28.8% in CO) as we move to the new China VI standard, although such benefit was not observed in NOx emissions.",

        "Abstract": "Ecosystem management in the face of uncertain disturbances has triggered increasing practices of resilience thinking. A multiscale probabilistic simulation-optimization framework is developed based on the nested nature of watersheds to inform decision robustness for Best Management Practices (BMPs). We presented a novel approach using hybrid Bayesian Networks (BNs) as interpretable and probabilistic emulators of process-based models. The hybrid BNs established at the scale of Hydrologic Response Units (HRUs) are embedded into simulation-optimization, whereby we analyze the cost-effectiveness-robustness of candidate BMP strategies at the subbasin scale. The optimal strategy is identified in compliance with water quality standards using watershed-scale integer programming. We apply the approaches in a typical intensively cultivated plateau watershed adjacent to Lake Dianchi, one of the three most eutrophic lakes in China. Our findings suggest that the hybrid BNs, incorporating both quantitative and qualitative information, are reliable emulators of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) in capturing critical pathways of diffuse phosphorus. Tradeoffs among cost, effectiveness, and robustness follow the law of diminishing marginal benefits. The optimum BMP strategies vary with policymakers’ preference toward robustness levels. Our findings indicate that robustness should be accounted for as an additional decision attribute besides costs and pollution mitigation. The benefits of the modeling framework are to (i) reduce over 99% computation complexity and support efficient decision-making under multifaceted uncertainties; (ii) improve interpretability and reliability of machine learning emulators; and (iii) inform policymakers of robustness with the probability of water quality restoration success.",

        "Abstract": "Background: Emerging evidence shows the detrimental impacts of particulate matter (PM) on poor semen quality. High-resolution estimates of PM concentrations are conducive to evaluating accurate associations between traffic-related PM exposure and semen quality. Methods: In this study, we firstly developed a random forest model incorporating meteorological factors, land-use information, traffic-related variables, and other spatiotemporal predictors to estimate daily traffic-related PM concentrations, including PM2.5, PM10, and PM1. Then we enrolled 1310 semen donors corresponding to 4912 semen samples during the study period from January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2019 in Guangzhou city, China. Linear mixed models were employed to associate individual exposures to traffic-related PM during the entire (0–90 lag days) and key periods (0–37 and 34–77 lag days) with semen quality parameters, including sperm concentration, sperm count, progressive motility and total motility. Results: The results showed that decreased sperm concentration was associated with PM10 exposures (β: -0.21, 95 % CI: −0.35, −0.07), sperm count was inversely related to both PM2.5 (β: -0.19, 95 % CI: −0.35, −0.02) and PM10 (β: -0.19, 95 % CI: −0.33, −0.05) during the 0–90 days lag exposure window. Besides, PM2.5 and PM10 might diminish sperm concentration by mainly affecting the late phase of sperm development (0–37 lag days). Stratified analyses suggested that PBF and drinking seemed to modify the associations between PM exposure and sperm motility. We did not observe any significant associations of PM1 exposures with semen parameters. Conclusion: Our results indicate that exposure to traffic-related PM2.5 and PM10 pollution throughout spermatogenesis may adversely affect semen quality, especially sperm concentration and count. The findings provided more evidence for the negative associations between traffic-related PM exposure and semen quality, highlighting the necessity to reduce ambient air pollution through environmental policy.",

        "Abstract": "The transition toward carbon-neutral electricity is one of the biggest game changers in addressing climate change since it addresses the dual challenges of removing carbon emissions from the two largest sectors of emitters: electricity and transportation. The transition to a carbon-neutral electric grid poses significant challenges to conventional paradigms of modern grid planning and operation. Much of the challenge arises from the scale of the decision-making and the uncertainty associated with the energy supply and demand. Artificial intelligence (AI) could potentially have a transformative impact on accelerating the speed and scale of carbon-neutral transition, as many decision-making processes in the power grid can be cast as classic, though challenging, machine-learning tasks. We point out that to amplify AI's impact on carbon-neutral transition of the electric energy systems, the AI algorithms originally developed for other applications should be tailored in three layers of technology, markets, and policy.",

        "Abstract": "Stress is an increasingly prevalent mental health condition that can have serious effects on human health. The development of stress prediction tools would greatly benefit public health by allowing policy initiatives and early stress-reducing interventions. The advent of mobile health technologies including smartphones and smartwatches has made it possible to collect objective, real-time, and continuous health data. We sought to pilot the collection of heart rate variability data from the Apple Watch electrocardiograph (ECG) sensor and apply machine learning techniques to develop a stress prediction tool. Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) were used to model stress based on ECG measurements and stress questionnaire data collected from 33 study participants. Data were stratified into socio-demographic classes to further explore our prediction model. Overall, the RF model performed slightly better than SVM, with results having an accuracy within the low end of state-of-the-art. Our models showed specificity in their capacity to assess “no stress” states but were less successful at capturing “stress” states. Overall, the results presented here suggest that, with further development and refinement, Apple Watch ECG sensor data could be used to develop a stress prediction tool. A wearable device capable of continuous, real-time stress monitoring would enable individuals to respond early to changes in their mental health. Furthermore, large-scale data collection from such devices would inform public health initiatives and policies.",

        "Abstract": "Connected systems through computerized networks are at the heart of the Industry of the future. As they merge physical entities with cyber spaces, they fall under the paradigm of cyber-physical production systems. Cybersecurity is a key challenge for such systems, as they are subject to daily attempts of intruders to gain unauthorized access to their internal resources or to compromise their integrity. The fast increase of new attack strategies requires the rapid design and assessment of new defense strategies. It entails a complex, error-prone and time-consuming process, including the clear specification of the attack and defense strategies involved, and the design and implementation of the simulation model allowing to evaluate the performances of the defense strategy. This work intends to make such a process transparent to cybersecurity managers by limiting their workload to the sole specification of the characteristics of the system and the logic of the attack and the defense. It provides a generic hybrid simulation framework for flexible evaluation of cybersecurity policies, which is demonstrated on a SYN flooding application. Therefore, the contribution is twofold: (1) The proposed framework offers a high-level environment allowing various experts to collaborate by graphically modeling a given attack strategy and the envisioned defense strategy, without engaging in heavy implementation efforts. Then the framework's executable infrastructure, which combines simulation with machine learning to understanding the interactions between the attackers & the defender, will allow them assessing the performances of these strategies. The proposed framework differs from state-of-the-art cybersecurity simulation environments in its uniqueness to combining the expressive power of a universal simulation modeling formalism with the user-friendliness of a visual simulation tool. Therefore, it offers at one side, a very high modeling flexibility for easy exploration of various cybersecurity strategies, and at the other side, integrated learning capabilities for allowing self-adaptive user-based cybersecurity strategy design. (2) The application demonstrating the framework focuses on the most encountered and still uncontrolled threats in cybersecurity, i.e. the SYN-Flooding based Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The application targeted is not meant to propose yet another SYN flood detection algorithm or to improve the state-of-the-art in that domain, but to prove the framework operationality. The experimental results obtained showcase the ability of the framework to support learning simulation-based SYN flood defense algorithm design and validation.",

        "Abstract": "Network slice management and, more generally, resource orchestration should be fully automated in 6G networks, as envisioned by the ETSI ENI. In this context, artificial intelligence (AI) and context-aware policies are certainly major options to move in this direction and to adapt service delivery to changing user needs, environmental conditions and business objectives. In this paper, we step towards this objective by addressing the problem of optimal placement of dynamic virtual networks through a self-adaptive learning-based strategy. These constantly evolving networks present, however, several challenges, mainly due to their stochastic nature, and the high dimensionality of the state and the action spaces. This curse of dimensionality requires, indeed, a broader exploration, which is not always compatible with a real-time execution in an operational network. Thus, we propose DQMC, a new strategy for virtual network embedding in mobile networks combining a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) strategy, namely a Deep Q-Network (DQN), and Monte Carlo (MC). As learning is costly in time and computing resources, and sensitive to changes in the network, we suggest a control-theory-based techniques to dynamically leverage exploration in DQMC. This leads to fast, efficient, and sober learning compared to a Monte Carlo-based strategy. This also ensures a reliable solution even in the case of a change in the requests’ sizes or a node's failure, showing promising perspectives for solutions combining control-theory and machine learning.",

In situations where the overall resource of the system cannot support loading, we propose a QoE-dnven optimization technique. The strict data forwarding policies conventionally prevent this situation. But this would lead to a high probability of blocking and loose revenues for operators. We propose re-adapting the applications, taking into consideration the applications' utility functions. This strategy improves the quality of experience for certain systems and for a fixed number of users and allows more users to be admitted to a predetermined quality.

        "Abstract": "Introduction: Past studies have found students to perform differently between class grades and standardized test scores – two essential and complementary measures of student achievement. This study examines predictors of the relative performance between these two measures in the context of the advanced placement (AP) program, namely, we compared students’ AP exam scores to the class grade they received in the corresponding AP course. For example, if a student received a high AP class grade but a low AP exam score, what characteristics about the student or their learning context might explain such discrepancy? Methods: We used machine learning, specifically random forests, and model interpretation methods on data collected from 381 high school students enrolled in an AP Statistics course in the 2017–2018 academic year, and additionally replicated our analyses on a separate cohort of 422 AP Statistics students from the 2018–2019 academic year. Results: Both analyses highlighted students’ school and behavioral engagement as predictors of differential performance between AP class grades and AP exam scores. Discussion: Associations between behavioral engagement and differential performance suggest that the ways in which a student interacts with AP course material to obtain high class grades can differ from study habits that lead to optimal performance on the AP exam. Additionally, school-level differences in relative performance pose equity concerns towards the use of AP exam scores in high-stakes decisions, such as college admissions. Implications are discussed from a pedagogical and policy perspective.",

        "Abstract": "Macro malware has always been a severe threat to cyber security although the Microsoft Office suite applies the default macro-disabling policy. Among the defense solutions at different stages of the attack chain, document analysis is more targeted through detecting malicious documents with macro malware. It is effective, especially with machine learning methods, but still faces problems handling malware variants, supporting file formats, and attack countermeasures with advanced attack techniques (e.g., Excel 4.0 macro and remote template injection). In this paper, we find it promising to detect deceptive information embedded in documents which tricks users into enabling macros instead of detecting file metadata or extracted macro codes. Thus, we propose a novel solution for macro malware detection named DitDetector, which leverages bimodal learning based on deceptive images and text. Specifically, we extract preview images of documents based on an image export SDK of Oracle and extract textual information from preview images based on an open-source OCR engine. The bimodal model of DitDetector contains a visual encoder, a textual encoder, and a forward neural network, which learns based on the joint representation of the two encoders' outputs. We evaluate DitDetector on three datasets, including an open-source malicious document dataset (i.e., MalDoc) and two collected real-world adversary datasets (i.e., a database of Excel macros and a database of remote template injection samples). Our experiments show that DitDetector outperforms four existing macro code-based machine learning methods and five reputable Anti-Virus engines. Especially in the real-world test of advanced macro malware, DitDetector gets the F1-score of 99.93% which is at least 3.16% higher than compared solutions.",

Unfortunately, creating and modifying context-sensitive access control solutions in dynamic environments creates ongoing challenges to manage the authorization contexts. This article proposes RASA, a context-sensitive access authorization approach and mechanism leveraging unsupervised machine learning to automatically infer risk-based authorization decision boundaries. We explore RASA in a healthcare usage environment, wherein cyber and physical conditions create context-specific risks for protecting private health information. The risk levels are associated with access control decisions recommended by a security policy. A coupling method is introduced to track coexistence of the objects within context using frequency and duration of coexistence, and these are clustered to reveal sets of actions with common risk levels; these are used to create authorization decision boundaries. In addition, we propose a method for assessing the risk level and labelling the clusters with respect to their corresponding risk levels. We evaluate the promise of RASA-generated policies against a heuristic rule-based policy. By employing three different coupling features (frequency-based, duration-based, and combined features), the decisions of the unsupervised method and that of the policy are more than 99% consistent.",

        "Abstract": "A building energy management system (BEMS) is a computer-based system designed to monitor and control a building's energy needs. Modern BEMS rely on the sensing and connectivity capabilities of Internet of Things (IoT) technology to intelligently adjust the energy consumption to reduce cost while respecting the consumers' preferences. Increasingly, control decisions are made based on predictions by models trained using supervised machine learning methods, which still requires control policies to be formulated in a rule-based fashion. When using reinforcement learning (RL) instead, control policies are learned by observing the utility in terms of cost and comfort associated with actions such as a change in the heating system's setpoint. The resulting RL-based controllers can capture not only the dynamics of the building and the associated electrical devices, but also fluctuations in electricity prices and user demand, avoiding the need to combine multiple predictive models with tailored control policies. This chapter will provide an overview of RL-based approaches for BEMS. After sketching the taxonomy of general RL methods, we discuss the implications of relying on the individual methods in a BEMS context. Existing work applying RL is presented along the key devices controlled by BEMS systems. Finally, we summarize the state-of-the-art and sketch limitations and open research directions.",

The model on which it is based can be used with little configuration to interact with humans in full autonomy, but it also allows fine real-time control of its generative processes and interaction strategies, closer in this case to a “smart” digital instrument. An offspring of the Omax system, conceived at the Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique/Musique (IRCAM), the Somax2 environment is part of the European Research Council Raising Cocreativity in Cyber–Human Musicianship (REACH) project, which studies distributed creativity as a general template for symbiotic interaction between humans and digital systems. It fosters mixed musical reality involving cocreative AI agents. The REACH project puts forward the idea that cocreativity in cyber–human systems results from the emergence of complex joint behavior, produced by interaction and featuring cross-learning mechanisms. Somax2 is a first step toward this ideal, and already shows life-size achievements.

        "Abstract": "The disruptive impacts of climate change have created an urgent need to transition to a low carbon economy and an important part of this transition is an increase in the usage of clean energy. The greater adoption of clean energy is creating new opportunities for clean energy equity investing. The existing literature mostly focuses on the dynamic relationship between clean energy equities, oil prices, technology stock prices, and other important macroeconomic variables like market volatility and economic policy uncertainty. However, there is a shortage of literature on forecasting clean energy stock prices. Forecasting clean energy equity prices is important for making investment decisions. This paper uses machine learning methods to predict the direction of clean energy stock prices. The analysis reveals that random forests, extremely randomized trees, stochastic gradient boosting, and support vector machine have higher prediction accuracy than Lasso or Naïve Bayes. For forecasts in the 10-day to 20-day range, random forests, extremely randomized trees, stochastic gradient boosting, and support vector machine achieve prediction accuracies greater than 85 %. In some cases, prediction accuracy reaches 90%. Lasso prediction accuracy is higher than Naïve Bayes but never greater than 65 %. The MA200, MA50, and WAD technical indicators are, on average, the features most important for predicting clean energy stock price direction. Of the non-technical indicators, VIX and OVX are consistently ranked high in importance. In most cases, EPU is not one of the most important features, Of the forecasting methods considered, extremely randomized trees are very impressive due to high accuracy and short computational time.",

        "Abstract": "Introduction: The proximity of semi-natural habitats and agricultural fields in an agricultural landscape leads to unavoidable biological, chemical, and physical interactions. Fungi can negatively influence, but also support crop growth in agricultural fields. Therefore, in this field study we investigated the colonisation of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and non-AM fungi in winter-wheat roots as well as winter-wheat performance in distance to semi-natural habitats. Materials and Methods: We sampled in an intensively managed agricultural landscape in North-east Germany along agricultural transition zones, that is, along 50 m-transects from semi-natural habitats like hedgerows and glacially created in-field ponds—so-called kettle holes—into agricultural fields. Results: To our knowledge, we show for the first time that AM fungal colonisation in winter-wheat roots decreased linearly with increasing distance to semi-natural habitats while non-AM fungal root colonisation did not change. Winter-wheat grain yield and biomass slightly increased with increasing distance to hedgerows but not to kettle holes. This clearly shows that there is a difference between different crop performance parameters. Random forest machine learning algorithms confirmed the particular importance of distance to semi-natural habitats for AM fungal root colonisation and for winter-wheat grain yield. Less intensive agricultural management close to semi-natural habitats, for example, no herbicide and pesticide applications as a result of nature protection regulations, may partly explain this pattern. However, spatial response patterns of AM but not of non-AM fungi in wheat roots also point to changed ecological interactions close to semi-natural habitats. Conclusion: Semi-natural and natural habitats in agricultural landscapes are slowly recognised not only to be important for biodiversity conservation, but also for sustainable crop production. Additionally, they may also be a tool for farmers and policy makers to improve sustainable landscape management. And agricultural transition zones are spatially and temporally complex dynamic ecosystems that should be the focus of further investigations.",

        "Abstract": "Cities have become primary actors on climate change and are increasingly setting goals aimed at net-zero emissions, which warrants closer examination to understand how they intend to meet these goals. The incomplete and heterogeneous nature of city climate policy documents, however, has made systemic analysis challenging. We analyze 318 climate action documents from cities with net-zero targets using machine learning-based natural language processing (NLP) techniques. We aim to accomplish two goals: (1) determine text patterns that predict ‘ambitious’ net-zero targets; and (2) perform a sectoral analysis to identify patterns and trade-offs in climate action themes. We find that cities with ambitious climate actions tend to emphasize quantitative metrics and specific high-emitting sectors in their plans. Cities predominantly emphasize energy-related actions in their plans, but often at the expense of other sectors, including land-use and climate impacts. The method presented in this paper provides a replicable, scalable approach to analyzing climate action plans and a first step towards facilitating cross-city learning.",

        "Abstract": "China’s economic level and people’s living standards have developed rapidly in recent years, and the medical level and medical technology have made breakthroughs continuously. With the promotion and deepening of “Internet Plus” to business model innovation in various fields, the development of “Internet Plus” medical has been rapidly developed. Due to the continuous development of data processing technologies such as machine learning and data mining, the risk of users’ personal medical data disclosure in the process of online medical treatment has also attracted the attention of researchers. Considering the deductibility of information, the discount mechanism was adopted to describe the change of user’s private information value in different stages of the game. Combined with the current research status in the field of online medical privacy protection motivation, how to mobilize the enthusiasm of both players from the level of privacy protection motivation was explored with game analysis. In view of the game characteristics of users’ strong willingness to continually use the online medical platform and intermittently provide privacy, the repeated game method was adopted to better describe the game process between users and the online medical platform. The tendency change law of the players on both sides of the game was obtained. Moreover, the Nash equilibrium of the game model was analyzed under different model parameters and the change trend of the game strategy of both sides with the progress of the game stage. When the parameters were met 2(cp−cn)≥lp(pn−pp), the user started to choose from “agree to share private data” to “refuse to share private data”. The above conclusion was verified by simulation experiments. Based on the above conclusions, from the perspective of online medical platform and users, policy suggestions on how to realize privacy protection from the level of privacy protection motivation in the process of online medical treatment were given.",

        "Abstract": "In the literature it is commonly accepted that the best mechanism to control smoking is by increasing tobacco prices via taxes. However, there are some studies that indicate that the decrease in tobacco consumption when prices rise is because consumer income is not capable of counteracting said rise. The empirical analysis was developed using a panel of data from the Spanish provinces covering 2002 to 2018. By using Machine Learning assembly models, the importance of price, GDP and affordability as a mechanism for controlling the demand for cigarettes is estimated. The importance of affordability to control tobacco consumption in Spain has grown over time. Furthermore, until 2010, income has generally better explained the demand for cigarettes in the Spanish provinces. However, as of 2010, price is the explanatory variable of the demand function that best explains the behavior of the demand for cigarettes. In these circumstances, the separate estimates of price and income elasticity that have been carried out in Spain so far must be interpreted considering that as of 2010, price is more important than income in explaining the demand for cigarettes. Furthermore, when the relative income price reaches 1%, there seems to be a positive relationship between this variable and the importance of price in explaining the demand for tobacco. Although the demand functions estimated so far are useful to make predictions about the behavior of cigarette demand, the government must consider that price is a good tool to control tobacco consumption from a certain point of affordability. Specifically, it appears that when the relative income price exceeds 1%, the importance of price as a tool to control legal cigarette sales grows each time the relative income price rises.",

        "Abstract": "We live in a datafied society in which our personal data is being constantly harvested, analyzed, and sold by public and private entities, and yet we have little control over our data and little voice in how it is used. In light of the impacts of algorithmic decision-making systems—including those that run on machine learning and artificial intelligence—there are increasing calls to integrate public participation into the adoption, design, and oversight of these tech tools. Stakeholder input is particularly crucial for members of marginalized groups, who bear the disproportionate harms of data-centric technologies. Yet, recent calls for public participation have been mostly hortatory and without specific strategies or realistic recommendations. As this Article explains, policy makers need not operate from a blank slate. For decades, a variety of American statutory regimes have mandated public participation, such as in the areas of environmental law, land use law, and anti-poverty programs. Such mandates have had outsized effects on communities suffering from economic disadvantage and racial and ethnic discrimination. This Article contends that we should examine these regulatory mandates in thinking about how to include the perspectives of marginalized stakeholders in the datafied society. The core takeaway is that meaningful public participation is extremely challenging and does not happen without intentional and inclusive design. At its best, public input can improve outputs and empower stakeholders. At its worst, it operates as a form of “window dressing,” in which marginalized communities have no real power to effect outcomes, thus generating distrust and alienation. Case studies show that meaningful public participation is most likely to result when there are hard-law requirements for public participation and when decision-makers operate transparently and recognize the value of the public’s expertise. In addition, impacted communities must be provided with capacity-building tools and resources to support their engagement. As legislative proposals to enhance tech accountability—through algorithmic impact assessments, audits, and other tools—gain steam, we must heed these lessons.",

As an alternative to the expert method, a forecast importance assessment method based on gradient-boosted machine learning algorithm analysis of a decision informational field with the subsequent interpretation of acquired results with Shapley values, allowing for a numerical representation of importance. This method is suggested for use as a tool to increase efficiency of intellectual decision-making support systems by the means of including it in the procedure of automated analysis of importance of features.

        "Abstract": "With the recent development of machine learning, reinforcement learning is an interesting alternative to PID controllers. In this context, a discrete predictive Q-learning approach is applied in the control of a sugarcane biorefinery multiple-effect evaporation system. The algorithm is built using Scilab and learns to control the multiple-effect evaporator outlet concentration by manipulating its feed steam flow rate. Based on multiple episodes, the state-actions that consist of discrete changes in steam flow rate are chosen with a greedy algorithm. In order to increase the training efficiency and overcome the large dead time of the system, a neural network is applied to predict the outlet concentration of each control action after reaching the steady-state. The control policy was built and tested through simulations on a phenomenological model. The controller performance was evaluated in set-point tracking and disturbance rejection tests and compared with PID responses. The research showed that the Q-learning controller exhibited better performance than the PID controller.",

        "Abstract": "This study developed a reinforcement learning-based energy management agent that controls the fine dust concentration by controlling facilities such as blowers and air conditioners to efficiently manage the fine dust concentration in the station. To this end, we formulated an optimization problem based on the Markov decision-making process and developed a model for predicting the concentration of fine dust in the station by training an artificial neural network (ANN) based on supervised learning to develop the transfer function. In addition to the prediction model, the optimal policy for controlling the blower and air conditioner according to the current state was obtained based on the ANN to which the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm was applied. In the case study, it is confirmed that the ANN and DQN of the predictive model were trained based on the actual data of Nam-Gwangju Station to converge to the optimal policy. The comparison between the proposed method and conventional method shows that the proposed method can use less power consumption but achieved better performance on reducing fine dust concentration than the conventional method. In addition, by increasing the value of the ratio that represents the compensation due to the fine dust reduction, the learned agent achieved more reduction on the fine dust concentration by increasing the power consumption of the blower and air conditioner.",
