        "Abstract": "Synthesized human trajectories are crucial for a large number of applications. Existing solutions are mainly based on the generative adversarial network (GAN), which is limited due to the lack of modeling the human decision-making process. In this article, we propose a novel imitation learning-based method to synthesize human trajectories. This model utilizes a novel semantics-based interaction mechanism between the decision-making strategy and visitations to diverse geographical locations to model them in the semantic domain in a uniform manner. To augment the modeling ability to the real-world human decision-making policy, we propose a feature extraction model to extract the internal latent factors of variation of different individuals and then propose a novel self-attention-based policy net to capture the long-term correlation of mobility and decision-making patterns. Then, to better reward users' mobility behavior, we propose a novel multi-scale reward net combined with mutual information to model the instant reward, long-term reward, and individual characteristics in a cohesive manner. Extensive experimental results on two real-world trajectory datasets show that our proposed model can synthesize the most high-quality trajectory data compared with six state-of-the-art baselines in terms of a number of key usability metrics and can well support practical applications based on trajectory data, demonstrating its effectiveness. Furthermore, our proposed method can learn explainable knowledge automatically from data, including explainable statistical features of trajectories and statistical relation between decision-making policy and features.",

        "Abstract": "This research addresses the static and dynamic unpredictable nature of their surroundings, which presents challenges for mobile robots operating in uncertain contexts, sometimes hindering their ability to learn appropriate policies. In this paper, a method based on reinforcement learning (RL) techniques is proposed to enhance the learning process of mobile robots through adaptive reward mechanisms. The system continuously modifies the rewards obtained during the learning process with the goal of improving the resilience and adaptability of robot behaviour. This investigation covers various RL algorithms, such as Deep Q-Networks (DQN), Improvement of Proximal Policy Optimization (IPPO) and Actor-Critic techniques, along with reward schemes that are flexible and customized to the specific demands of mobile robot activities. It assesses the effectiveness of these strategies in terms of learning efficiency, flexibility to changes in the environment and robustness to uncertainty through extensive testing in simulated scenarios.

        "Abstract": "Methane from rice fields has a strong greenhouse effect and its accurate estimation is essential to combat climate change. In this study, we conducted an analysis based on the Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) model using Local Data Assimilation and Prediction System (LDAPS) data, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) from VIIRS and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and FluxNet ground observations of the Cheorwon rice paddy region. This was used to estimate methane emissions from rice paddy fields in South Korea and to create a gridded spatial information map of methane concentrations. Using data with a spatial resolution of 1.5 kilometers, we identified detailed changes within the region and generated daily maps to analyze daily changes and seasonal characteristics. To predict methane concentration, we considered the correlation between meteorological factors such as latent heat flux, humidity, soil moisture, and soil temperature and methane emissions as key variables. Latent heat flux and humidity were selected as key variables considering that the migration of methane gas is affected by the evapotranspiration process. In addition, soil moisture, which creates the anaerobic conditions necessary for methane production, and soil temperature, which affects the activity of methanogenic microorganisms, were included in the analysis. Taking these various factors into consideration, we analyzed methane emission data from rice fields in Korea and visualized them on a map to understand the pattern of methane production in response to changing weather conditions. The developed model showed a correlation coefficient of 0.91 and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 28.97 in the 5-fold cross-validation and an average correlation coefficient of 0.87 and MAE of 35.46 in the Leave One Year Out (LOYO) cross-validation. These results are expected to contribute to the understanding of methane generation patterns under changing weather conditions and accurate methane emission estimation. In addition, the developed model and the constructed methane concentration map can be utilized as an important basis for establishing greenhouse gas reduction policies in the agricultural sector and effective climate change response strategies in the future.",

        "Abstract": "In the present work, a prediction on the wind energy potential in Semarang City (Central Java Province, Indonesia) has been performed by leveraging a novel combination of machine learning and natural neighbor interpolation (NNI) methodology. This integrated approach uniquely combines the predictive power of machine learning to estimate wind speeds based on historical and spatial data, with the spatial mapping capabilities of NNI, which provides a more accurate and seamless visualization of wind speed distribution. This combination addresses challenges of data sparsity and variability, offering a more reliable and localized mapping approach than traditional methods. Additionally, air density is considered to calculate energy density, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of wind energy potential. The results show an average monthly wind speed of 5.23 m/s, ranging from 3.38 m/s to 7.39 m/s. Wind speeds between 7 m/s and 10 m/s are predicted to occur for up to 10 months annually, with an estimated energy density of 102.7 W/m2. These findings underscore the feasibility of small-scale wind power generation in the study area and provide actionable insights for advancing renewable energy policies and implementations at the local level.",

With a significant gap in qualified emergency medicine professionals, a need exists to rapidly upskill the current health workforce and to strengthen access to learning for non-specialist emergency care providers nationally. This review was completed in partnership with the Ugandan Ministry of Health and a consortium of UK partners to support national emergency workforce capacity building in Uganda and East Africa. The review built on policy and practice expertise to explore the feasibility of using emerging digital solutions, such as virtual and augmented reality, to meet the challenges of delivering rapid and equitable access to emergency care training at scale. Data collection included a narrative literature review, key informant interviews, an expert focus group, a technical workshop and field observations. Findings included (1) the identification of local technology expertise and experience, in direct contrast to literature and global perceptions of low-resource environments, (2) high and broad levels of national engagement with digital solutions, (3) existing ambition and infrastructure available to feasibly deliver training at scale and (4) delivery implications for comparable contexts. The review concludes that these emerging technologies should be considered a practical option in the design and delivery of health workforce training at scale. A series of recommendations are proposed for the policy and practice of health professional education and training in Uganda and for comparable contexts.",

        "Abstract": "Transport decarbonization including railway electrification has become a global trend in tackling the climate change challenge due to the substantive green-house-gas emissions from the transport sector. However, within the context of the rapidly growing electricity demand due to railway decarbonization, the existing power supply infrastructures are often stretched beyond their rating capacity, thus slowing down the railway electrification pace. To address this challenge, this paper presents a novel railway microgrid solution to economically and efficiently cater for the growing electricity demands of the railway sector. The proposed railway microgrid uses the existing traction network, local renewable generations and local power grid as its energy sources to meet both the traction and non-traction loads in the electrified railway systems. It also employs hydrogen storage systems and aggregated electric vehicle (EV) fleets to support flexible energy scheduling. To address the uncertainty of renewable energy and implement efficient energy scheduling, machine learning tools and agents are introduced in formulating and solving the optimal scheduling problem, including bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) and an improved twins-actor deep deterministic policy gradient (Twins-Actor DDPG) method. To reduce the overall computational complexity, a fast recursive algorithm (FRA) is adopted to streamline the machine learning agents. Case studies confirm that the proposed optimal microgrid operation can achieve up to 18.7% costs reduction for the daily operation of the railway power supply system while meeting the electricity demand, and FRA can achieve up to 78.6% agent size reduction and 93.1% computational cost savings.",

        "Abstract": "Achieving a robust Energy Management Strategy (EMS) for Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) requires meeting several control objectives, such as drivability, reducing fuel consumption, and maintaining the state of battery charge (SoC), making the EMS a critical component of HEVs. The current EMS relies on prior knowledge of the instantaneous optimal working points of the Internal Combustion Engine (ICE), which leads to suboptimal solutions in episodic driving cycles. Previous efforts to implement Reinforcement Learning (RL) encountered challenges such as slow convergence, instability in tracking driving cycles, and inadequate performance under real driving conditions. This paper presents an intelligent EMS based on a hybrid Knowledge-Assisted system that integrates a Deterministic Policy Gradient (KA-DDPG) and a Deep Q-Network (KA-DQN) to overcome the challenges of RL and achieve optimal EMS actions under various driving conditions. Two versions of the proposed algorithm—offline and online—are presented. Simulation results show that KA-DDPG requires less computation time, reduces fuel consumption by 6.99 %–7.26 % in offline mode and 5.18 %–5.67 % in online mode, and maintains SoC stability. These methods improve average negative electric motor torque and result in greater energy savings, while the robustness of the algorithm has been examined by changing the vehicle's weight.",

        "Abstract": "With the rapid development of intelligent transportation system(ITS) and network technology, vehicles can receive more information about traffic conditions. Although many researchers have conducted the research on eco-driving, many methods ignore the unsafety of reinforcement learning agent or use complex mechanism to improve behavior or they set simple reward function to express the relationship between the SOC and fuel consumption. This paper proposes a safe-off policy eco-driving strategy(SOPEDS) based on a hierarchical frame for a hybrid electric truck in a truck-following scenario in order to solve the problems. Firstly, the truck-following strategy in the upper layer is designed based on the deep deterministic policy gradient(DDPG) algorithm. Then the relevant safe mechanism is introduced in order to reduce the collision risk. In the lower layer, the energy management strategy designed by using reinforcement learning(RL) algorithm. And a new function is designed to shape the reward function to guide agent learning. Finally, the performance of the proposed method is proved by experiments. The results show the fuel saving rate can reach 97.46% of the DP. Our research improved driving safety and introduced a reward function design method which is meaningful for RL training processing for other vehicles.",

        "Abstract": "Energy poverty in Missouri was analyzed using the four quadrant approach using both state and county level data sets for two separate definitions of the grid. Predictions used machine learning techniques including decision trees, random forest, extreme gradient boosting and support vector machines. It was determined that the extreme gradient boosting performed the best when compared to all the other models after the hyperparameters were tuned. The F1 scores for the county level data sets were higher than for the state levels thus indicating greater predictability for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) climatological regional runs. For the county level data, the F1 score was the highest for region 1, which coincided with one of the highest expenditure risk values whilst regions 2–4 were the lowest scoring area. In grid 2, the largest class distribution changed from grid 1’s expenditure risk to the no risk category. This grid had more variability in terms of the double risk class when compared to grid 1 and, as such, its predictability in terms of its F1 scores was reduced. There were similarities in the ranking of the prediction scores for the regions for both grids as regions 1 and 6 incurred the largest F1 values. Thus energy poverty can be classified and predicted for Missouri, which in turn may aid policy makers via quantitative regional risk analysis. This data-driven informed policy making can lead to the development and implementation of laws and social programs to help ameliorate energy poverty.",

        "Abstract": "As new energy sources increasingly penetrate novel power systems, the coordinated control of frequency regulation units has become more challenging, leading to the degraded performance of power grid control. The automatic generation control methods based on traditional reinforcement learning overly depend on exploration, making it difficult quickly obtain optimal solutions for multi-area cooperative control and resulting in suboptimal performance. To address this issue, this paper proposes a multi-area coordinated control method using a greedy actor-critic algorithm enhanced with expert experience replay. This method decouple the role of entropy for exploration and policy collapse, utilizing a proposal policy to secure high-value actions for policy updates. Thus the exploration and exploitation are balanced and the local optima is avoided. Additionally, the expert experience replay collects expert demonstration data with high-value to assist the learning of multi-agent. Therefore, the meaningless exploration in early training is reduced and the rapid attainment of optimal solutions is facilitated. This paper validates the proposed method through simulations on the model of the improved IEEE standard two-area load frequency control and the model of the Sichuan, Chongqing, and Hubei three-area. Compared with other various reinforcement learning methods, the proposed method is demonstrated with superior control performance.",

Addressing this, this paper proposes a novel energy management framework in retired battery-integrated microgrid with grid frequency regulation (FR) and peak shaving. The EV battery can be hierarchically utilized by the two-stage control framework to improve economic efficiency. In the first stage energy management, a novel heuristic algorithm called the walrus optimization algorithm (WaOA) is employed to implement the optimal energy scheduling of microgrid for minimizing operating costs. In the second stage control strategy, a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) agent is applied to dynamically adjust the power sharing of energy storage station according to the states of retired batteries. Furthermore, a comprehensive retired battery aging model is incorporated into the proposed strategy to reduce total battery capacity loss. The simulation results verify the superior performance of the proposed energy management framework under various microgrid scenarios. This work provides a practical approach to the cascaded utilization of EV batteries, which further improves the sustainability and economics of EV batteries.",

Hydrogen is used as a commodity in this framework since its production can improve grid stability and system operational flexibility, decarbonize heavy industry, and create an additional revenue stream for electricity generators, particularly nuclear power plants with high operational expenses. The proposed solution addresses the challenges associated with merging multiple software and services from various domains by using functional mock-up units (FMU) to co-simulate diverse subsystems designed in various platforms. The tightly coupled integrated energy system (IES) is optimized to maximize revenue by utilizing the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique to make smart dispatching decisions based on variable electricity prices and the availability of renewable energy. Proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm is used in training and testing the DRL agent. Over a period of 120 days, the proposed hydrogen-based IES framework showed about 10% revenue boost compared to a non-hydrogen generating baseline IES while also providing an easily-adoptable framework which can help to improve the flexibility of future generation nuclear power plants.",

However, the existing DRL approaches for managing water systems cannot consider information from multiple time steps, are prone to overestimation, fall into the problem of locally optimal solutions, and fail to cope with time-varying environments, resulting in an inability to minimize energy consumption while considering water comfort and hygiene of occupants. Therefore, this study proposes an incremental learning user profile and deep reinforcement learning (ILUPDRL) method for controlling hot water systems. This study employs hot water user profiles to reflect the hot water demand (HWD) habits. The proposed ILUPDRL addresses the challenges arising from evolving HWD through incremental learning of hot water user profiles. Moreover, to enable the ILUPDRL to consider information from multiple time steps, this study proposes the recurrent proximal policy optimization (RPPO) algorithm and integrates the RPPO into the ILUPDRL. The simulation results show that the ILUPDRL achieves up to 67.53 % energy savings while considering the water comfort and water hygiene of occupants.",

        "Abstract": "Background and Objective: Chest radiography, otherwise known as chest X-ray (CXR) is the most in demand and widely performed investigation in radiology department; owing to the multiple combining effect of rise in prevalence of respiratory diseases globally and the growing need of heath assessment for pre-employment, pre-operative and migration purposes. However, this task is already proving overwhelming, placing an immeasurable burden of workload on radiographers, radiologist, and the entire health system; this has resulted in long waiting time, fatigue-based technical error, interpretation error, reporting delays and backlogs. To ameliorate this predicament, medical imaging has witnessed the introduction of artificial intelligence (AI). Thus, with the raid evolutionary trend in technology, this article seeks to review current state of evidence on AI use in CXR and level of progress made to minimize these errors and delays. In addition, point out challenges, as well as unfold areas for future research to better detection rates and improve overall clinical outcomes. Methods: A search for relevant literature that focuses on AI in CXR was conducted with the help of certain keywords [machine learning (ML), chest radiography, deep learning (DL), natural language processing (NLP), expert system (ES) and fuzzy logic (FL)]. Thereafter, a narrative logical approach to technically analysing and synthesizing findings across domains of AI (ML, DL, NLP, ES, FL) and robot technologies as it relates to CXR done. Key Content and Findings: A thorough evaluation of the substance of evidence these studies bring to enhance overall workflow and health outcomes show that ML is very useful in performing administrative and imaging tasks such as exam scheduling, worklist management and image acquisition. On the other hand, DL is better suited for classification tasks on a broad spectrum of chest anomalies in CXR. However, a hybrid approach involving ML-DL, FL-DL and NLP-DL/ML technologies seems to further improve reporting accuracy and offer more insights into CXR interpretation. Further studies on training and refining models for clinical use in this perspective is demanded. Conclusions: AI still in its early stages; this review to serve as road map to implementation and policy making, guide routine practice and improve clinical governance.",

        "Abstract": "Code based adversarial attacks play a crucial role in revealing vulnerabilities of software system. Recently, pre-trained programming language models (PLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in various significant software engineering tasks, progressively transforming the paradigm of software development. Despite their impressive capabilities, these powerful models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Therefore, it is necessary to carefully investigate the robustness and vulnerabilities of the PLMs by means of adversarial attacks. Adversarial attacks entail imperceptible input modifications that cause target models to make incorrect predictions. Existing approaches for attacking PLMs often employ either identifier renaming or the greedy algorithm, which may yield sub-optimal performance or lead to high inference times. In response to these limitations, we propose CARL, an unsupervised black-box attack model that leverages reinforcement learning to generate imperceptible adversarial examples. Specifically, CARL comprises a programming language encoder and a perturbation prediction layer. In order to achieve more effective and efficient attack, we cast the task as a sequence decision-making process, optimizing through policy gradient with a suite of reward functions. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of CARL on code summarization, code translation, and code refinement tasks, covering various programming languages and PLMs. The experimental results demonstrate that CARL surpasses state-of-the-art code attack models, achieving the highest attack success rate across multiple tasks and PLMs while maintaining high attack efficiency, imperceptibility, consistency, and fluency.",

This research introduces fresh insights on the relationship between green finance policies and carbon emissions through a natural experiment and the use of machine learning methods to address the endogeneity problem. Based on green finance data mainly from 1997 to 2021, the empirical results show the following: (1) Green finance development in any form can promote the reduction of carbon emission. (2) A higher level of tertiary industry and economic development stands for positive influences on the effect of green finance on reducing carbon emissions. (3) Meanwhile, regions with proper energy consumption structure performance better in suppressing carbon emissions through green finance. (4) Innovations have a positive mediating impact of green finance system on the reduction in carbon emission. According to the findings, it is recommended that decision-makers weigh the potential to align green financing with carbon emissions cuts in order to achieve economic and societal advantages. This should take into account the considerable prospects present in developing areas and the need for equilibrium among innovation, consumption, and economic levels.",

However, whether the transformational changes induced by digital technologies affect corporate innovation and the underlying mechanisms have not been fully explored. Based on panel data from Chinese listed firms spanning from 2012 to 2021, this paper constructs a measure of digital transformation using machine learning techniques and investigates its relationship with corporate innovation. The findings suggest that digital transformation effectively promotes corporate innovation, a result robust to a battery of sensitivity checks. Mechanism analysis reveals that digital transformation significantly enhances innovation by increasing R&D input and improving innovation efficiency. Further analysis indicates that the innovation-promoting effect of digital transformation is mainly manifested in high-quality innovation output, with greater benefits observed for state-owned enterprises and non-high-tech industry enterprises. Overall, our study provides valuable policy insights for enhancing innovation levels among enterprises in developing countries like China through digital transformation strategies.",

        "Abstract": "This article introduces a hybrid framework for trustworthy and responsible natural resource management, aimed at building bottom-up trust to enhance cooperation among decision-makers in the food, energy, and water sectors. Cooperation is highly critical for the adoption and application of resource management alternatives (solutions), including those generated by AI-based recommender systems, in communities due to significant impact of these sectors on the environment and the economic productivity of affected communities. While algorithms can recommend solutions, effectively communicating and gaining community acceptance of these solutions is crucial. Our research stands out by emphasizing the collaboration between humans and machines, which is essential for addressing broader challenges related to climate change and the need for expert tradeoff handling in the management of natural resources. To support future decision-making, we propose a successful control-theory model based on previous decision-making and actor behavior. We utilize control theory to depict how community decisions can be affected by how much individuals trust and accept proposed solutions on irrigation water rights and crop operations in an iterative and interactive decision support environment. This model interacts with stakeholders to collect their feedback on the acceptability of solutions, while also examining the influence of consensus levels, trust sensitivities, and the number of decision-making rounds on the acceptance of proposed solutions. Furthermore, we investigate a system of multiple decision-making and explore the impact of learning actors who adjust their trust sensitivities based on solution acceptance and the number of decision-making rounds. Additionally, our approach can be employed to evaluate and refine potential policy modifications. Although we assess potential outcomes using hypothetical actions by individuals, it is essential to emphasize our primary objective of developing a tool that accurately captures real human behavior and fosters improved collaboration in community decision-making. Ultimately, our aim is to enhance the harmony between AI-based recommender systems and human values, promoting a deeper understanding and integration between the two.",

        "Abstract": "Dynamic Learning-to-Rank (DLTR) is a method of updating a ranking policy in real time based on user feedback, which may not always be accurate. Although previous DLTR work has achieved fair and unbiased DLTR under inaccurate feedback, they face the tradeoff between fairness and user utility and also have limitations in the setting of feeding items. Existing DLTR works improve ranking utility by eliminating bias from inaccurate feedback on observed items, but the impact of another pervasive form of inaccurate feedback, overlooked or ignored interesting items, remains unclear. For example, users may browse the rankings too quickly to catch interesting items or miss interesting items because the snippets are not optimized enough. This phenomenon raises two questions: (i) Will overlooked interesting items affect the ranking results? and (ii) Is it possible to improve utility without sacrificing fairness if these effects are eliminated? These questions are particularly relevant for small and medium-sized retailers who are just starting out and may have limited data, leading to the use of inaccurate feedback to update their models. In this article, we find that inaccurate feedback in the form of overlooked interesting items has a negative impact on DLTR performance in terms of utility. To address this, we treat the overlooked interesting items as noise and propose a novel DLTR method, the Co-teaching Rank (CoTeR), that has good utility and fairness performance when inaccurate feedback is present in the form of overlooked interesting items. Our solution incorporates a co-teaching-based component with a customized loss function and data sampling strategy, as well as a mean pooling strategy to further accommodate newly added products without historical data. Through experiments, we demonstrate that CoTeR not only enhances utilities but also preserves ranking fairness and can smoothly handle newly introduced items.",

        "Abstract": "Addressing climate change requires significant reductions in global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In Australia, agriculture accounts for approximately 16.8% of total emissions. Despite advancements in emissions accounting, critical gaps remain, particularly concerning the data-driven selection of reference years and the use of aggregated metrics. These issues often overlook sectoral dynamics, highlighting the need for context-specific, disaggregated baselines that more accurately reflect the complexities of emission assessment from agriculture. This study presents an analytical methodology that integrates machine learning (ML) techniques, specifically dynamic Generalised Additive Models (GAMs) and Conditional Inference Trees (CITs). Applied to 30 years of CO2-e data from Australian inventories, the ML-based approach predicted significant periods of aggregated emissions: from 1990 to 2005 and from 2006 to 2022, with 2005 identified as a critical transition point. The analysis revealed a significant decline in aggregated emissions, with a median of 70.5 Mt CO2-e over the past five years, down from a peak of 76.4 Mt CO2-e estimated in 2005. By optimising the bias-variance trade-off, the algorithms effectively captured underlying patterns while accounting for variability due to climate-related extreme events, such as the Millennium Drought. Another key contribution of this research is the establishment of accurate and adaptable sector- and activity-level baselines, which enhance decision-making related to resource allocation and performance targets. Although applied to Australian agricultural emissions data, this methodology has global applicability. As climate variability intensifies, its predictive and benchmarking capabilities can improve the utility of historical data, supporting dynamic, data-driven approaches crucial for facilitating the net-zero transition.",

        "Abstract": "Tracking the spread of emerging pathogens is critical to the design of timely and effective public health responses. Policymakers face the challenge of allocating finite resources for testing and surveillance across locations, with the goal of maximizing the information obtained about the underlying trends in prevalence and incidence. We model this decision-making process as an iterative node classification problem on an undirected and unweighted graph, in which nodes represent locations and edges represent movement of infectious agents among them. To begin, a single node is randomly selected for testing and determined to be either infected or uninfected. Test feedback is then used to update estimates of the probability of unobserved nodes being infected and to inform the selection of nodes for testing at the next iterations, until certain test budget is exhausted. Using this framework, we evaluate and compare the performance of previously developed active learning policies for node selection, including Node Entropy and Bayesian Active Learning by Disagreement. We explore the performance of these policies under different outbreak scenarios using simulated outbreaks on both synthetic and empirical networks. Further, we propose a policy that considers the distance-weighted average entropy of infection predictions among neighbors of each candidate node. Our proposed policy outperforms existing ones in most outbreak scenarios given small test budgets, highlighting the need to consider an exploration-exploitation trade-off in policy design. Our findings could inform the design of cost-effective surveillance strategies for emerging and endemic pathogens and reduce uncertainties associated with early risk assessments in resource-constrained situations.",

        "Abstract": "Administrator-centered access control failures can cause data breaches, putting organizations at risk of financial loss and reputation damage. Existing graphical policy configuration tools and automated policy generation frameworks attempt to help administrators configure and generate access control policies by avoiding such failures. However, graphical policy configuration tools are prone to human errors, making them unusable. On the other hand, automated policy generation frameworks are prone to erroneous predictions, making them unreliable. Therefore, to find ways to improve their usability and reliability, we conducted a Systematic Literature Review analyzing 49 publications. The thematic analysis of the publications revealed that graphical policy configuration tools are developed to write and visualize policies manually. Moreover, automated policy generation frameworks are developed using machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to automatically generate access control policies from high-level requirement specifications. Despite their utility in the access control domain, limitations of these tools, such as the lack of flexibility, and limitations of frameworks, such as the lack of domain adaptation, negatively affect their usability and reliability, respectively. Our study offers recommendations to address these limitations through real-world applications and recent advancements in the NLP domain, paving the way for future research.",

        "Abstract": "Background The ever-increasing number of patients diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and treated by long-term continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) overstretches conventional follow-up pathways. New approaches to the management of CPAP-treated patient follow-up are needed to strike a balance between remote monitoring through digital technologies and in-person patient-healthcare-professional contacts. Focusing on the reshaping of the management of care pathways of CPAP-treated patients, with a specific focus on telemonitoring platforms, we aimed to review the evidence on how digital medicine and artificial intelligence (AI) tools are facilitating patient phenotyping and triage, risk stratification and the allocation of resources between the various healthcare professionals for an optimal follow-up of CPAP-treated patients. Phenotyping OSA is a heterogeneous condition with diverse phenotypes differing in symptoms, comorbidities, demographics, lifestyle and socioeconomic context. Different phenotypes are associated with different CPAP adherence patterns and differing long-term prognosis. This diversity demands greater plurality in management pathways with different types and levels of support to ensure treatment adherence and risk reduction for patients while easing the burden on health services. In multidimensional phenotyping, we discuss alternatives to the apnoea hypopnoea index (AHI) as a measure of OSA severity. Then we consider risk stratification taking advantage of the wealth of CPAP monitoring data already available in databases that can now be exploited using AI and machine learning to direct (stratify) patients into appropriate follow-up management pathways. Integrated care clinics for high-risk patients We look at the role of integrated OSA care clinics particularly for the management of high-risk patients with low adherence and progression of comorbidities. Here, multidisciplinary teams might propose comorbidity management, and the use of connected wearable devices for long-term monitoring of physical activity, along with remote CPAP monitoring. Remote management pathways The pros and cons of remote management pathways to replace in-person follow-up visits are considered, including the need to re-evaluate CPAP-device reimbursement policies in some countries. While remote CPAP monitoring has become the cornerstone of follow-up providing information on adherence and efficacy, the processing of alerts needs to be improved, particularly regarding mask changes and early detection of CPAP failures. Challenges The implementation of CPAP monitoring alone, as well as its extension to multimodal monitoring, can present challenges that remain to be addressed (eg, access to digital care). The extent and components of remote follow-up must be adapted to each specific OSA phenotype. Finally, we give examples of certain patient phenotypes (eg, comorbid insomnia with OSA) with specific follow-up requirements, for which remote (even multimodal) monitoring alone has limitations and the intervention of both sleep specialists and/or their colleagues from other disciplines is needed. Conclusion Appropriately tailored combined digital and in-person CPAP follow-up pathways would present advantages both for patients with OSA and healthcare services.",

        "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The use of hashtags is a common way to promote e-cigarette content on social media. Analysis of hashtags may provide insight into e-cigarette promotion on social media. However, the examination of text data is complicated by the voluminous amount of social media data. This study used machine learning approaches (ie, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers [BERT] topic modeling) to identify e-cigarette content on TikTok. AIMS AND METHODS: We used 13 unique hashtags related to e-cigarettes (eg, #vape) for data collection. The final analytic sample included 12 573 TikTok posts. To identify the best fitting number of topic clusters, we used both quantitative (ie, coherence test) and qualitative approaches (ie, researchers checked the relevance of text from each topic). We, then, grouped and characterized clustered text for each theme. RESULTS: We evaluated that N = 18 was the ideal number of topic clusters. The 9 overarching themes were identified: Social media and TikTok-related features (N = 4; \"duet,\" \"viral\"), Vape shops and brands (N = 3; \"store\"), Vape tricks (N = 3; \"ripsaw\"), Modified use of e-cigarettes (N = 1; \"coil,\" \"wire\"), Vaping and girls (N = 1; \"girl\"), Vape flavors (N = 1; \"flavors\"), Vape and cigarettes (N = 1; \"smoke\"), Vape identities and communities (N = 1; \"community\"), and Non-English language (N = 3; Romanian and Spanish). CONCLUSIONS: This study used a machine learning method, BERTopic modeling, to successfully identify relevant themes on TikTok. This method can inform future social media research examining other tobacco products, and tobacco regulatory policies such as monitoring of e-cigarette marketing on social media. IMPLICATIONS: This study can inform future social media research examining other tobacco products, and tobacco regulatory policies such as monitoring of e-cigarette marketing on social media.",

        "Abstract": "As the world's supply chains become disrupted through geopolitical instability and the race towards a net-zero future, policies have been implemented to improve the security of certain minerals and raw materials critical to a country's survival and sustainability goals. Circular economies (CE) are sought to be an ecosystem that will reduce virgin material consumption rates, lower carbon emissions, and decelerate the rate of landfilling. However, cost-effective and commercially attractive substitutes to conventional products are needed for this to be realised. Machine learning (ML) and the explosion of interest in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to growing interests in predictive and generative applications for sustainability. Phosphorous and, nutrients overall, operate on finite reserves essential for food supply chains; while such nutrients are largely present in municipal wastewater streams. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) must then face a transformational force to become nutrient recovery centres, rather than follow a linear treat-for-disposal model. In this framework paper, ML is positioned as an enabler for scaled, cost-effective and safer recovery of nutrients and other valuable products — tying in economic, societal, technical and commercial factors through open data connectivity. Moreover, the paper issues a policy guide for institutions wishing to advance food, energy and water security through machine learning, circular economy wastewater treatment plants (ML CE WWTP).",

        "Abstract": "A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is a type of enterprise that operates on a decentralized structure where all members have equal contribution, right, and decision-making in the organization. This organization makes use of smart contracts, a software where the rules and policies of the organization are embedded. They are susceptible to threats and fraudulent activities which compromise their security. A flaw in the DAO's smart contract could lead to exploitation by hackers. This research is aimed at developing a fraud detection system using machine learning models and evaluating the performance of the system using standard performance metrics. Machine learning algorithms were employed to detect frauds in the DAO platform built under the Ethereum blockchain using a dataset of transactions, consisting of fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions. Algorithms employed were the logistic regression, XGBoost, and random forest. These models were built and trained, and hyper parameter tuning was carried out on them. The results obtained from the evaluation metrics show that random forest and XGBoost give better results when compared to logistic regression. Logistic regression had accuracy and precision of 82.07% and 55.53%. Random forest had accuracy and precision of 98.52% and 96.49%. For XGBoost, its accuracy and precision are 98.12% are 93.33%. Other evaluation metrics were used in carrying out analysis, showing the best performing models, the random forest and the XGBoost. At the end of this research, a model for predicting threats in DAO was developed for the ecosystem. The developed system could be utilized in making predictions from past information like patterns of transactions and other available features, to ascertain if the account is fraudulent or not, that account can be terminated.",

        "Abstract": "Diabetes has far-reaching implications, not only for those directly affected but also for caregivers, families, and communities. Unhealthy eating and sedentary lifestyles fuel the diabetes surge. Challenges to effectively controlling blood sugar in patients stem from limited access to specialized care, poor medication adherence, and inadequate self-care motivation. Nonetheless, healthcare is rapidly transforming, with state-of-the-art digital technologies like smartphone apps, telemedicine, m-health, device integration, machine learning, and AI poised to reshape diabetes management. These innovations offer great potential to improve care efficacy and encourage patients to play a more active self-care role. These innovations hold immense potential to enhance the efficacy of diabetes management while empowering patients to take a more active role in their self-care. The current healthcare system has given some great instances of overhauling the diabetes ecosystem by utilizing the possibilities of digital transformation. A revolutionary shift in diabetes management via digital transformation offers tremendous potential for optimizing healthcare cost and resource efficiency. This approach promises to elevate the quality and uniformity of diabetes care, transcending geographical constraints and also contributing to enhanced governance and policy formulation across diverse healthcare sectors. Furthermore, it catalyzes encouraging innovation and fostering collaboration among industry stakeholders, ultimately leading to the development of innovative products and solutions that support diabetes management and care. To create a better, more attainable future for individuals with diabetes, this chapter focuses on the most recent digital and technological developments and breakthroughs to identify the appropriate device for diabetes monitoring and management.",

        "Abstract": "Anticipating future migration trends is instrumental to the development of effective policies to manage the challenges and opportunities that arise from population movements. However, anticipation is challenging. Migration is a complex system, with multifaceted drivers, such as demographic structure, economic disparities, political instability, and climate change. Measurements encompass inherent uncertainties, and the majority of migration theories are either under-specified or hardly actionable. Moreover, approaches for forecasting generally target specific migration flows, and this poses challenges for generalisation. In this paper, we present the results of a case study to predict Irregular Border Crossings (IBCs) through the Central Mediterranean Route and Asylum requests in Italy. We applied a set of Machine Learning techniques in combination with a suite of traditional data to forecast migration flows. We then applied an ensemble modelling approach for aggregating the results of the different Machine Learning models to improve the modelling prediction capacity. Our results show the potential of this modelling architecture in producing forecasts of IBCs and Asylum requests over 6 months. The explained variance of our models through a validation set is as high as 80%. This study offers a robust basis for the construction of timely forecasts. In the discussion, we offer a comment on how this approach could benefit migration management in the European Union at various levels of policy making.",

Here, we estimate the forest biomass loss in Europe due to fires, windthrows, and insect outbreaks over 1979–2018 and evaluate potential adaptation benefits by integrating machine learning with disturbance data and satellite products. Results show an average overall annual biomass loss of 41.6 ± 5.3 Mt at European level subject to a significant rise of 2.3 ± 0.3 Mt year−1, largely influenced by climate change (72%–98%). The contribution of insect outbreaks appears prominent (79%) compared to windthrows (20%) and fires (1%) and linked to their upsurge after the year 2000. However, impacts vary greatly across Europe depending on local environmental conditions. We estimate that enhancing ecosystem heterogeneity could reduce biomass loss by about 18%, and such action should therefore be fostered in forest adaptation policies.",

        "Abstract": "An efficient execution plan generation is crucial for optimizing database queries. In exploring large table spaces to identify the most optimal table join orders, traditional cost-based optimizers may encounter challenges when confronted with complicated queries. Thus, learning-based optimizers have recently been proposed to leverage past experience and generate high-quality execution plans. However, these optimizers demonstrate limited generalization capabilities for workloads with diverse distributions. In this study, an adaptive plan selector based on reinforcement learning is proposed to address these issues. However, three challenges remain: (1) How to generate optimal multi-table join orders? We adopt an exploration–exploitation strategy to traverse the vast search space composed of candidate tables, thereby evaluating the significance of each table. Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are subsequently used to predict the performance of join orders and generate high-quality candidate plans. (2) How to automatically learn new features in novel datasets? We employ the Actor–Critic strategy, which involves jointly cross-training the policy and value networks. By adjusting the parameters based on real feedback obtained from the database, the new datasets are automatically learnt. (3) How to automatically select the best plan? We introduce a constraint-aware optimal plan selection model that captures the relationship between constraints and plans. This model guides the selection of the best plan under constraints of execution time, cardinality, cost, and mean-squared error (MSE). The experimental results on real datasets demonstrated the superiority of the proposed approach over state-of-the-art baselines. Compared with PostgreSQL, we observed a reduction of 29.73% in total latency and 28.36% in tail latency.",

        "Abstract": "Active flow control based on reinforcement learning has received much attention in recent years. Indeed, the requirement for substantial data for trial-and-error in reinforcement learning policies has posed a significant impediment to their practical application, which also serves as a limiting factor in the training of cross-case agents. This study proposes an in-context active flow control policy learning framework grounded in reinforcement learning data. A transformer-based policy improvement operator is set up to model the process of reinforcement learning as a causal sequence and autoregressively give actions with sufficiently long context on new unseen cases. In flow separation problems, this framework demonstrates the capability to successfully learn and apply efficient flow control strategies across various airfoil configurations. Compared with general reinforcement learning, this learning mode without the need for updating the network parameter has even higher efficiency. This study presents an effective novel technique in using a single transformer model to address the flow separation active flow control problem on different airfoils. Additionally, the study provides an innovative demonstration of incorporating reinforcement-learning-based flow control with aerodynamic shape optimization, leading to collective enhancement in performance. This method efficiently lessens the training burden of the new flow control policy during shape optimization, and opens up a promising avenue for interdisciplinary intelligent co-design of future vehicles.",

Using mobile applications in a flipped classroom (FC) setting enhances learning outcomes and fosters the development of critical skills. This paper proposes a mobile application integrated with a FC model to improve secondary education students’ DQ. The study utilized an experimental research design with a one-group pretest-posttest approach to compare students’ DQ, analyzed using a paired sample t-test, and assessed student satisfaction. The sample consisted of 60 lower secondary school students under Thailand’s Nakhon Pathom Secondary Education Service Area Office. The research findings are as follows: 1) The developed learning model was rated as highly appropriate; 2) The content and technical quality of the FC mobile application was rated very good; 3) Students’ DQ significantly improved after using the application, with a statistical significance level of 0.05. Among the eight sub-skills, screen time management showed the highest improvement; and 4) Student satisfaction with the learning model was at the highest level. Based on these findings, the developed model can enhance students’ DQ and is adaptable for other audiences requiring digital navigation skills, making the results relevant to broader educational objectives beyond traditional coursework.",

        "Abstract": "Heatwaves have substantial but poorly quantified impacts on surface ozone photochemical regimes. As heatwaves of increasing severity occur, communities face more serious exposure to ozone, necessitating a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of heatwaves on the nonlinear response of ozone to its precursors for guiding policies in emission reductions. Here we estimate the spatiotemporal evolution of global ozone chemistry based on machine learning and in situ observations and show that emission changes and heatwaves alter ozone photochemical regimes, leading to diverse ozone changes across regions. Sustained emission reductions in East Asia decreased the ozone formation sensitivity to formaldehyde (HCHO) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5), counteracting the adverse high-temperature effect. Quantified results reveal that heatwaves increased the sensitivity of ozone to HCHO and PM2.5, enhancing their positive contributions and causing increased ozone trends across most regions, with a global average anomaly of 9.4 μg/m3. Meanwhile, heatwave-induced PM2.5 anomalies concentrated in wildfire-risk zones, coupled with increased HCHO, elevated downwind ozone levels. Specifically, the effects in wildfire-endangered western Canada and heatwave-exposed southeastern United States contributed to a chemically driven ozone increase of 0.18 μg/m3/month in Northern America. Our results demonstrate that more targeted and substantial regulation of volatile organic compounds will be beneficial in mitigating future intensifying climate penalty effects.",

        "Abstract": "There is an urgency to detect in legal acts the corresponding provisions where a policy is implemented, to track its evolution over time, to measure the effectiveness of the norms, and to evaluate the impact on society. From this perspective, the Sustainable Development Goals program (SDG) provides a fundamental instrument for monitoring ground basis pillar of the world wide policies. In this work, we propose a method which leverages both the structural nature of legislative documents in AKN-XML and unsupervised machine learning to perform a match between individual articles and definitions and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals, yielding a more fine-grained annotation of individual articles and definitions, instead of the preexisting document-level annotation. Our work provides better traceability of the SDGs policies in the EU legislation permitting the legislator to detect the articles where the association is weakest. During the legal drafting, our tool could be integrated into the editor to suggest better legal definitions for improving the implementation of the SDGs.",

        "Abstract": "Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have brought the world to the threshold of significant new technological breakthroughs. These developments bring new opportunities and challenges to existing and potential entrepreneurs, raising pressing and promising research questions. We review emerging but fast-growing literature on impacts of AI on entrepreneurship, providing a resource for researchers in entrepreneurship and neighboring disciplines. We begin with a review of definitions of AI and show that ambiguity and broadness of definitions adopted in empirical studies may result in obscured evidence on impacts of AI on entrepreneurship. Against this background, we present and discuss existing theories and evidence on how AI technologies affect entrepreneurial opportunities and decision-making under uncertainty, the adoption of AI technologies by startups, entry barriers, and the performance of entrepreneurial businesses. We add an original empirical analysis of survey data from the German Socio-economic Panel revealing that entrepreneurs, particularly those with employees, are aware of and use AI technologies significantly more frequently than paid employees. Next, we discuss how AI may affect entrepreneurship indirectly through impacting local and sectoral labor markets. The reviewed evidence suggests that AI technologies that are designed to automate jobs are likely to result in a higher level of necessity entrepreneurship in a region, whereas AI technologies that transform jobs without necessarily displacing human workers increase the level of opportunity entrepreneurship. More generally, AI impacts regional entrepreneurship ecosystems (EE) in multiple ways by altering the importance of existing EE elements and processes, creating new ones, and potentially reducing the role of geography for entrepreneurship. Lastly, we address the question of how the regulation of AI may affect the entrepreneurship landscape by focusing on the case of the European Union and its data protection and AI legislation. We conclude our survey by discussing implications for entrepreneurship research and policy.",

        "Abstract": "Aman rice, a major staple crop in Bangladesh, is cultivated during the monsoon season and is highly dependent on climatic conditions such as rainfall and temperature. This study aims to identify the most effective machine learning models for predicting Aman rice yields by leveraging 52 years of historical data (1970–2022). Data preprocessing included outlier correction, statistical imputation, and aggregation of monthly averages for varibales like rainfall, temperature, humidity and others during the monsoon (June–September). Various machine learning models - Random Forest, Neural Network, Decision Tree, Linear Regression, and Gradient Boosting - were employed to capture yield trends under changing climatic conditions. Each model was evaluated based on Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R-squared (R2), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Random Forest emerged as the most accurate model showing robustness to climate variability through sensitivity analysis. While Gradient Boosting also performed well, though with slightly higher error margins. Linear Regression provided reasonable outputs, but it struggled with non-linear patterns. In contrast, Neural Networks and Decision Trees showed less accuracy in capturing intricate relationships between climate variables and rice yields. The Random Forest model predicts Aman rice yields to reach 133.31 metric tonnes by 2030 (34.11 % of total rice production) and 140 metric tonnes by 2050 (32.86 %). Climate projections suggest a rise in temperatures from 26.5°C to 37.41 °C in 2030 to 27.33°C-38.26 °C by 2050, with monsoon rainfall increasing slightly from 302.37 mm to 305.7 mm. These changes in climatic conditions could place additional stress on rice production, especially due to higher temperatures. The findings align with international studies highlighting the challenges that rising temperatures and fluctuating rainfall pose to crop yields. These findings emphasize the need for adaptive agricultural techniques and policies to mitigate climate change impacts on rice production, supporting food security and sustainable development in Bangladesh.",

        "Abstract": "Increased availability of smart meter data offers better insight into buildings’ electricity usage. By classifying smart meter data by building type and presence of heating appliances, we can efficiently gain metadata about the buildings that is useful for research, grid planning, and energy efficiency policy employment. However, current smart meter classification approaches are largely based on limited datasets and building classes, or on unsupervised methods that don't align with standard building categories and offer limited control over grouping. This article presents a supervised automatic building category classification approach for labelling smart meter data from buildings into standard building categories in the Norwegian building regulations (TEK17), and whether they have electric heating or not. 82 novel physics-based domain features are presented which can be extracted from any hourly electricity smart meter data series from buildings with a duration of months-years. The features are specifically designed to identify the building and heating type of a smart meter data series by capturing patterns such as seasonality, daily usage trends, similarities with standardized building load profiles, temperature dependency, and other domain-specific characteristics. The classification approach is trained and tested on a large dataset of 2724 buildings from 12 different building categories, both residential and non-residential, and correctly identifies the heating type and building category of unseen Norwegian smart meter data from buildings in 84 % of the test cases. The approach is generalizable to meter data from other Norwegian buildings and is also tested on buildings from other climate zones. The proposed method for smart meter data classification is proven to have high accuracy and applicability for extracting metadata for both residential and non-residential buildings in Norway.",

        "Abstract": "Grassland dynamics are modulated by management intensity and impact overall ecosystem functioning. In mowed grasslands, the first mowing date is a key indicator of management intensification. The aim of this work was to assess several supervised regression models for mapping grassland first mowing date at national-level using Sentinel-2 time series. Three deep-learning architectures, two conventional machine learning models and two threshold-based methods (fixed and relative) were compared. Algorithms were trained/calibrated and tested from field observations, using a spatial cross-validation approach. Our findings showed that time aware deep-learning models – Lightweight Temporal Attention Encoder (LTAE) and 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) – yielded higher performances compared to Multilayer Perceptron, Random Forest and Ridge Regression models. Threshold-based methods under-performed compared to all other models. Best model (LTAE) mean absolute error was within six days with a coefficient of determination of 0.52. Additionally, errors were accentuated at extreme (late/early) mowing dates, which were underrepresented in the data set. Oversampling techniques did not improve predicting extreme mowing dates. Finally, the best prediction accuracy was obtained when the number of clear dates surrounding the mowing event was greater than 2. Our outputs evidenced time aware deep-learning models’ potential for large-scale grassland first mowing event monitoring. A national-level map was produced to support bird-life monitoring or public policies for biodiversity and agro-ecological transition in France.",

        "Abstract": "Northeast Asia suffers from high concentrations of particulate matter (PM), prompting nations to actively implement emission reduction policies. This study evaluated the recent inter-annual changes in the chemical transformation and transboundary transport of PM over Northeast Asia, based on both ground and aircraft measurements, as well as WRF-Chem simulations, during two comprehensive campaigns: the Korea–United States Air Quality (KORUS-AQ) campaign in 2016 and the Satellite Integrated Joint Monitoring of Air Quality (SIJAQ) campaign in 2022, both conducted around the Korean Peninsula. Ground measurements in 2022 revealed significant reductions in air pollutants compared to 2016 levels. In the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region, PM2.5 and SO2 concentrations decreased by 47.2% and 73.9%, respectively, attributable to successful SOx and NOx emission reduction strategies. Similar trends were observed in downwind areas, including Seoul, where PM2.5 and SO2 levels declined by 30.0% and 41.4%, respectively. WRF-Chem model results indicated substantial decreases in sulfates, nitrates, and their precursors in both surface and upper atmosphere in 2022 compared to 2016. Moreover, model-calculated gas-to-particle conversion ratios, which peaked in the Yellow Sea in 2016, decreased by 15% in 2022 and shifted slightly eastward to the western Korean Peninsula. This shift suggests a potential decline in secondary PM formation processed in the Yellow Sea, coinciding with reduced long-range transport of gaseous pollutants. A comparison of model sensitivity experiments, accounting for both bottom-up emission changes and meteorological variations, revealed that while weather and climate factors such as precipitation and pressure patterns between 2016 and 2022 contributed to the overall decrease in PM concentrations, the primary driver was the reduction in emissions during this period. This study highlighted that the main driver of the substantial improvement in air quality over East Asia was the implementation of emission reduction policies targeting PM and its precursors in the main source regions in China.",

        "Abstract": "Lung nodules are frequently detected on low-dose computed tomography scans performed for lung cancer screening and incidentally detected on imaging performed for other reasons. There is wide variability in how lung nodules are managed by general practitioners and subspecialists, with high rates of guideline-discordant care. This may be due in part to the level of evidence underlying current practice guideline recommendations (primarily based on findings from uncontrolled studies of diagnostic accuracy). The primary aims of lung nodule management are to minimize harms of diagnostic evaluations while expediting the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of lung cancer. Potentially useful tools such as lung cancer probability calculators, automated methods to identify patients with nodules in the electronic health record, and multidisciplinary team evaluation are often underused due to limited availability, accessibility, and/or provider knowledge. Finally, relatively little attention has been paid to identifying and reducing disparities among individuals with screening-detected or incidentally detected lung nodules. This contribution to the American Cancer Society National Lung Cancer Roundtable Strategic Plan aims to identify and describe these knowledge gaps in lung nodule management and propose recommendations to advance clinical practice and research. Major themes that are addressed include improving the quality of evidence supporting lung nodule evaluation guidelines, strategically leveraging information technology, and placing emphasis on equitable approaches to nodule management. The recommendations outlined in this strategic plan, when carried out through interdisciplinary efforts with a focus on health equity, ultimately aim to improve early detection and reduce the morbidity and mortality of lung cancer. Plain Language Summary: Lung nodules may be identified on chest scans of individuals who undergo lung cancer screening (screening-detected nodules) or among patients for whom a scan was performed for another reason (incidental nodules). Although the vast majority of lung nodules are not lung cancer, it is important to have evidence-based, standardized approaches to the evaluation and management of a lung nodule. The primary aims of lung nodule management are to diagnose lung cancer while it is still in an early stage and to avoid unnecessary procedures and other harms.",

        "Abstract": "Accurate staging improves lung cancer survival by increasing the chances of delivering stage-appropriate therapy. However, there is underutilization of, and variability in, the use of guideline-recommended diagnostic tests used to stage lung cancer. Consequently, the American Cancer Society National Lung Cancer Roundtable (ACS NLCRT) convened the Triage for Appropriate Treatment Task Group—a multidisciplinary expert and stakeholder panel—to identify knowledge and/or resource gaps contributing to guideline-discordant staging and make recommendations to overcome these gaps. The task group determined the following: Gap 1: facilitators of and barriers to guideline-concordant staging are incompletely understood; Recommendation 1: identify facilitators of and barriers to guideline-concordant lung cancer staging; Gap 2: the level of evidence supporting staging algorithms is low-to-moderate; Recommendation 2: prioritize comparative-effectiveness studies evaluating lung cancer staging; Gap 3: guideline recommendations vary across professional societies; Recommendation 3: harmonize guideline recommendations across professional societies; Gap 4: existing databases do not contain sufficient information to measure guideline-concordant staging; Recommendation 4: augment existing databases with the information required to measure guideline-concordant staging; Gap 5: health systems do not have a performance feedback mechanism for lung cancer staging; Recommendation 5: develop and implement a performance feedback mechanism for lung cancer staging; Gap 6: patients rarely self-advocate for guideline-concordant staging; Recommendation 6: increase opportunities for patient self-advocacy for guideline-concordant staging; and Gap 7: current health policies do not motivate guideline-concordant lung cancer staging; Recommendation 7: organize a representative working group under the ACS NLCRT that promotes policies that motivate guideline-concordant lung cancer staging. Plain language summary: Staging—determining the degree of cancer spread—is important because it helps clinicians choose the best cancer treatment. Receiving the best cancer treatment leads to the best possible patient outcomes. Practice guidelines are intended to help clinicians stage patients with lung cancer. However, lung cancer staging in the United States often varies from practice guideline recommendations. This report identifies seven opportunities to improve lung cancer staging.",

        "Abstract": "The food recovery hierarchy (FRH) is an important concept widely used worldwide as a guideline for food waste management policies. It consists of different options for food waste management hierarchically organized, in which source reduction is the most preferable option, followed by food donation, feeding animals, industrial use, composting, energy recovery, and landfilling. The most common approaches used in the literature to validate the FRH concept consider both, a user-side and donor-side perspectives. While the former are typical of methods such as life cycle assessment and ecological footprint that are extensively explored in the literature, the latter is typical of methods such as eMergy accounting (EMA), a perspective that remains unexplored. This study aims to overcome that literature gap by discussing: (i) The validity of FRH concept under an EMA perspective; (ii) The differences on saving natural resources depending on the adopted FRH option; (iii) Obtaining a mathematical model representing the saved emergy as a function of invested emergy. Results show that the FRH is confirmed under the EMA lens as expressed by the proposed emergy return index (ERI). The most preferable options within FRH are by far more efficient in saving emergy than the least preferable options (about 250 times better). The obtained model EMS=2.44E+22/EMI 0.51 describes the relation between the invested and saved emergy along the FRH hierarchy. Insights are presented to promote discussions on existing ERIs cluster within the FRH.",

        "Abstract": "Background: Factors related to depression differ depending on the population studied, and studies focusing on the population of non-manual workers are lacking. Thus, we aimed to identify the risk factors related to depression in non-manual workers in China. Method: A large-scale cross-sectional survey was conducted between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2020, which included 264,557 non-manual workers from one large physical examination institution in China. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) was used to measure depression. A total of 73 variables covering aspects of sociodemographic characteristics, general examination data, health history, symptoms, eating habits, work situation, general sleep conditions and laboratory findings were included in the collection and analysis. Machine learning algorithms of neural networks and logistic regressions were used to assess the risk of depression and explore its factors. Results: Age, feeling fatigue, sleep quality, overeating, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL[sbnd]C) were found to be factors of depression. Two prediction models for depression among Chinese non-manual workers were developed with good AUC (0.820), accuracy (0.943), sensitivity (0.743–0.773), and specificity (0.700–0.729). Limitations: Data were collected at one time point only, meaning that this study cannot explain the causality of the factor on depression. Conclusions: Our finding that age, feeling fatigue, sleep quality, overeating, WHR, and HDL-C were risk factors for depression in non-manual workers may provide strong evidence for health care facilities to develop preventive measures or government policies for non-manual workers.",

        "Abstract": "Recently, the multi-cloud environment (MCE) has increasingly become the preferred choice of users. As with the cloud environment, efficient workflow scheduling in a MCE remains crucial for identifying the cost efficiency and overall performance of the MCE. In MCE, the resources exhibit heterogeneity, complexity, and dynamism. Simultaneously, the intricate inter-task dependencies among workflow tasks, diverse Quality of Service (QoS) metrics for users, and multiple cloud service providers’ (CSPs) billing mechanisms significantly amplify the workflow scheduling challenge. Motivated by the application of reinforcement learning (RL) in workflow scheduling in a cloud environment, this paper proposes a scheduling algorithm that takes advantage of the asynchronous advantage actor–critic algorithm (A3C) to balance cost, makespan and resource utilization in workflow scheduling in a MCE. By analyzing the elements in the MCE, we design and define multiple agents in the MCE, and each cloud service provider will have an agent to record the state and update the local parameters. For the workflow task submitted by the user, the action is selected according to the initialization policy and submitted to the scheduling action to allocate the task to a designated virtual machine in the MCE so that each agent can more clearly perceive the environment change and adapt to the MCE. In contrast to the traditional A3C algorithm, we design a new critic network according to the data characteristics of real-world scientific workflows so that each agent is more suitable for real-world scientific workflow data. Through multiple sets of simulation experiments, the workflow scheduling algorithm based on the A3C algorithm in the MCE (MCWS-A3C) was compared with three benchmark methods. The experimental results show that the proposed method has better advantages than other methods in terms of cost, makespan, and resource utilization. Specifically, on the Montage_100 dataset, the average cost was reduced by 55.12% compared to other methods. The pioneering introduction of the A3C algorithm that adapts to the dynamic environment into the MCE brings more possibilities to address the issue of workflow scheduling in the MCE.",

        "Abstract": "This study introduces an innovative methodology utilising deep learning and automated question-answering techniques to explore leadership dynamics. The research analyses 989 speeches from U.S. Presidents, ranging from George Washington to Joe Biden, applying a machine learning model to decipher the essence of effective leadership within the context of presidential rhetoric. This approach facilitates an interrogation of “What constitutes a great leader?” by extracting pertinent attributes from these presidential discourses. The study conducts a comprehensive statistical examination of the responses generated, unveiling the evolution of presidential perspectives on leadership across historical epochs. Furthermore, the research employs a regression analysis that extends over 120 years, integrating the attributes of outstanding leadership with the Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) index specific to the United States. The findings indicate that periods marked by heightened uncertainty necessitate leaders with a charismatic approach, whereas servant leadership is more effective during times of reduced uncertainty. An extensive validation and robustness assessment of the study affirm that the outcomes are steadfast, notwithstanding variations in key parameters of the deployed machine learning models. Moreover, these findings align coherently with the qualitative assessments of U.S. Presidential views on leadership undertaken in prior research, thus contributing novel insights into the intricate relationship between leadership qualities and historical and economic contexts.",

        "Abstract": "In many real-world decision-making tasks, multi-agent need to learn collaboration in a high-dimensional complex action space, rather than just a single discrete action space. Recently, value decomposition learning methods such as QMIX have emerged as a promising approaches for collaborative multi-agent tasks. However, most of the value decomposition algorithms can only be used in discrete action space, which would limit their practicability. To address the limitation, we propose a novel algorithm called Multi-Agent Sequential Q-Networks (MASQN), which can be applied to the multi-agent domains with continuous, multidiscrete or hybrid action spaces. The proposed algorithm is based on the structure of centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE). The decentralized actors ensure adaptability to different action spaces by utilizing action space discretization and sequential models, and the centralized critic utilizes the value decomposition architecture to guide effective updates of the policy parameters for each agent. We also give the convergence of joint policy from the perspective of policy iteration, by combining it with the CTDE structure and the constraint of the Individual Global Max (IGM) condition. Finally, we evaluate the MASQN algorithm on two benchmark environments: MAMuJoCo and Hybrid Predator–Prey. The empirical results show that MASQN out performs the state-of-the-art performance on three different action spaces.",

        "Abstract": "Virtual power plant (VPP) emerges as a promising integration and aggregation technology that facilitates the utilization of massive flexible demand-side resources (DSRs). However, non-negligible modeling errors and high-dimensional uncertainties involved in DSR aggregation threaten the delivery reliability and cost-effectiveness of VPP operation. To address this problem, this study proposes an integrated three-stage scheduling framework for VPPs and develops a model-assisted multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach. In the proposed framework, the VPP scheduling problem is formulated as a decentralized partially observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP), which depicts the complex interaction process among the three stages (bidding, re-dispatching and disaggregation). The interactions are evaluated by a comprehensive reward function, incorporating the trading and operation costs, as well as imbalance penalties. To enable decentralized decision-making, a model-assisted multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MA2PPO) algorithm is proposed, which trains a separate actor network for each aggregator. Additionally, the MA2PPO is augmented with a model-assisted safety decision-making method to accelerate the training process. Numerical simulation results verify that the proposed method enhances the delivery reliability and cost-effectiveness of the VPP, while achieving faster convergence time compared with purely model-free MARL methods.",

        "Abstract": "Climate protection goals and the transformation of the mobility sector are pushing the shipping industry to develop new propulsion systems emitting fewer or no greenhouse gases. One promising approach to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions from ships is a hybrid propulsion system powered by fuel cells and batteries. A high-temperature solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) can supply heat and the electrical power demand in combination with a battery. Due to the low dynamic performance of the SOFC when faced with sudden load changes, a battery is responsible for providing the power for the dynamic load components. To ensure the resource-efficient operation of the propulsion components, intelligent energy management methods are required for power distribution control. Implementing a machine-learning-based energy management method based on twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) improves the overall system efficiency, lifetime, and fuel economy compared to conventional energy management methods. To verify the technical feasibility of the propulsion system including its controls, the system is tested in a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) environment. By implementing the TD3-based algorithm within the energy management used on the test bench, hydrogen consumption was reduced by approximately 10% and the remaining battery capacity after five years was 6% higher in comparison to conventional energy management methods.",

        "Abstract": "Autonomous driving technology plays a crucial role in enhancing driving safety and efficiency, with the decision-making module being at its core. To achieve more human-like decision-making and accommodate drivers with diverse styles, we propose a method based on deep reinforcement learning. A driving simulator is utilized to collect driver data, which is then classified into three driving styles - aggressive, moderate, and conservative - using the K-means algorithm. A driving style recognition model is developed using the labeled data. We then design distinct reward functions for the Deep Q-Network (DQN), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithms based on the driving data of the three styles. Through comparative analysis, the SAC algorithm is selected for its superior performance in balancing comfort and driving efficiency. The decision-making models for different styles are trained and evaluated in the SUMO simulation environment. The results indicate that the aggressive model prioritizes efficiency over comfort, while the conservative model emphasizes comfort with reduced efficiency. This approach successfully accommodates the decision-making preferences of drivers with varying styles, demonstrating human-like decision-making capabilities.",

We first consider a linear learning-Augmented decentralized online algorithm (LADO-Lin) that combines a machine learning (ML) policy with a baseline expert policy in a linear manner. We show that, while LADO-Lin can exploit the potential of ML predictions to improve the average cost performance, it cannot have guaranteed worst-case performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel online algorithm (LADO) that adaptively combines the ML policy and expert policy to safeguard the ML predictions to achieve strong competitiveness guarantees. We also prove the average cost bound for LADO, revealing the tradeoff between average performance and worst-case robustness and demonstrating the advantage of training the ML policy by explicitly considering the robustness requirement. Finally, we run an experiment on decentralized battery management. Our results highlight the potential of ML augmentation to improve the average performance as well as the guaranteed worst-case performance of LADO.",

        "Abstract": "Background: A range of school-based interventions are effective in improving student diet and physical activity (e.g. school food policy interventions and classroom physical activity interventions), and reducing obesity, tobacco use and/or alcohol use (e.g. tobacco control programmes and alcohol education programmes). However, schools are frequently unsuccessful in implementing such evidence-based interventions. Objectives: The primary review objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of strategies aiming to improve school implementation of interventions to address students' (aged 5 to 18 years) diet, physical activity, obesity, tobacco use and/or alcohol use. The secondary objectives are to:. 1. determine whether the effects are different based on the characteristics of the intervention including school type and the health behaviour or risk factor targeted by the intervention; 2. describe any unintended consequences and adverse effects of strategies on schools, school staff or students; and 3. describe the cost or cost-effectiveness of strategies. Search methods: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), five additional databases, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), and the US National Institutes of Health registry (clinicaltrials.gov). The latest search was between 1 May 2021 and 30 June 2023 to identify any relevant trials published since the last published review. Selection criteria: We defined 'implementation' as the use of strategies to adopt and integrate evidence-based health interventions and to change practice patterns within specific settings. We included any randomised controlled trial (RCT) or cluster-RCT conducted on any scale, in a school setting, with a parallel control group that compared a strategy to improve the implementation of policies or practices to address diet, physical activity, obesity, tobacco use and/or alcohol use by students (aged 5 to 18 years) to no active implementation strategy (i.e. no intervention, inclusive of usual practice, minimal support) or a different implementation strategy. Data collection and analysis: We used standard Cochrane methods. Given the large number of outcomes reported, we selected and included the effects of a single outcome measure for each trial for the primary outcome using a decision hierarchy (i.e. continuous over dichotomous, most valid, total score over subscore). Where possible, we calculated standardised mean differences (SMDs) to account for variable outcome measures with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We conducted meta-analyses using a random-effects model. Where we could not combine data in meta-analysis, we followed recommended Cochrane methods and reported results in accordance with 'Synthesis without meta-analysis' (SWiM) guidelines. We conducted assessments of risk of bias and evaluated the certainty of evidence (GRADE approach) using Cochrane procedures. Main results: We included an additional 14 trials in this update, bringing the total number of included trials in the review to 39 trials with 83 trial arms and 6489 participants. Of these, the majority were conducted in Australia and the USA (n = 15 each). Nine were RCTs and 30 were cluster-RCTs. Twelve trials tested strategies to implement healthy eating practices; 17 physical activity, two tobacco, one alcohol, and seven a combination of risk factors. All trials used multiple implementation strategies, the most common being educational materials, educational meetings, and education outreach visits, or academic detailing. Of the 39 included trials, we judged 26 as having high risks of bias, 11 as having some concerns, and two as having low risk of bias across all domains. Pooled analyses found, relative to a control (no active implementation strategy), the use of implementation strategies probably results in a large increase in the implementation of interventions in schools (SMD 0.95, 95% CI 0.71, 1.19; I2 = 78%; 30 trials, 4912 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). This is equivalent to a 0.76 increase in the implementation of seven physical activity intervention components when the SMD is re-expressed using an implementation measure from a selected included trial. Subgroup analyses by school type and targeted health behaviour or risk factor did not identify any differential effects, and only one study was included that was implemented at scale. Compared to a control (no active implementation strategy), no unintended consequences or adverse effects of interventions were identified in the 11 trials that reported assessing them (1595 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Nine trials compared costs between groups with and without an implementation strategy and the results of these comparisons were mixed (2136 participants; low-certainty evidence). A lack of consistent terminology describing implementation strategies was an important limitation of the review. Authors' conclusions: We found the use of implementation strategies probably results in large increases in implementation of interventions targeting healthy eating, physical activity, tobacco and/or alcohol use. While the effectiveness of individual implementation strategies could not be determined, such examination will likely be possible in future updates as data from new trials can be synthesised. Such research will further guide efforts to facilitate the translation of evidence into practice in this setting. The review will be maintained as a living systematic review.",

        "Abstract": "The county level serves as a fundamental regional unit for an in-depth analysis of the relationship between agricultural carbon emissions and urbanization. Understanding the spatiotemporal evolution and driving mechanisms of agricultural carbon emissions at the county level is crucial for guiding green and low-carbon development in rural areas and advancing rural revitalization efforts. The aim of this study was to elucidate the spatiotemporal evolution patterns and driving factors of county-level agricultural carbon emissions in Guangdong Province from 2000 to 2022. This study systematically calculated agricultural carbon emissions for 124 counties (cities, districts) in Guangdong Province using the latest emissions inventory system. We collaboratively identified the key driving factors and spatiotemporal evolution patterns of agricultural carbon emissions at the county level by integrating GIS and machine learning techniques, including local spatial autocorrelation analysis and the random forest (RF) algorithm. The results were as follows: 1) Overall, agricultural carbon emissions at county level in Guangdong Province exhibited a downward trend from 2000 to 2020, with total emission being 4533.27×104, 3895.21×104, 4034.23×104 and 3553.97×104 t in 2000, 2010, 2016 and 2022, respectively, while carbon emissions within the province were uneven and had strong spatial heterogeneity. 2) Geographic Information System (GIS)-based local spatial autocorrelation analysis revealed distinct spatial clustering characteristics of agricultural carbon emissions. High-high values were predominantly located in Western Guangdong, whereas low-low values were concentrated in the core area of the Pearl River Delta. Notably, the degree of internal clustering within each region showed a continuous upward trend over time. 3) A notable distinction between agricultural carbon emissions per capita and total emissions was observed, with high-high values of emissions per capita appearing mainly in Northern Guangdong and Western Guangdong, while low-low values were concentrated in the Pearl River Delta and Eastern Guangdong, indicating a “spatial spillover” effect where emissions in densely populated urban areas impact surrounding regions. 4) The RF model, constructed using agricultural indicators selected through Pearson correlation analysis, identified the primary factors influencing agricultural carbon emissions. These included plowing area, fertilizer and pesticide usage, and total power of agricultural machinery. Among these indicators, the increase of fertilizer and pesticide usage was adverse to the reduction of agricultural carbon emissions, whereas the advancement of agricultural mechanization emerged as a positive driving factor for reducing agricultural carbon emissions. The results of this study highlight the complexity and regional variability of agricultural carbon emissions in Guangdong Province. The integration of local spatial autocorrelation and RF algorithms provides a robust analytical framework for understanding these dynamics. In addition, this study offers valuable policy insights and quantitative tools for regional agricultural carbon emission reduction and promotes green and low-carbon development strategies. Overall, our findings underscore the importance of targeted region-specific policies to address the unique challenges and opportunities within different areas of Guangdong Province. By leveraging advanced analytical techniques and comprehensive datasets, policymakers can better understand and mitigate the factors driving agricultural carbon emissions, paving the way for sustainable and environmentally friendly agricultural practices.",

A continuous transition from individual farms to the entire value chain is taking place thanks to agritech's ability to enable innovation at numerous points along value chains. Information and communication technology-based solutions are giving way to the Internet of Things and services that are enabled by artificial intelligence and machine learning in this industry. India's governmental policy reveals evidence of extensive collaboration and investment in the field, with a clear emphasis on the growth of data infrastructure. We identify the main determinants of DA's success in India as being smallholder dominance, diversity in production systems, the dominance of commodity crops, proximity to metropolitan markets, and state policy. A digital transformation of Indian agriculture is strongly suggested by the review of the technologies already available and their implementations by the public sector, tech giants, information technology leaders, and agri-food tech entrepreneurs in India.",

        "Abstract": "Transportation is widely recognized as a significant contributor to heavy metal (HM) pollution in roadside soils. A better understanding of HM pollution in soils near expressways is crucial, particularly given the rapid expansion of expressway transportation in China in recent years. In this study, 329 roadside topsoil samples were collected along the Beijing-Tianjin Expressway, which connects two megacities in China. Chemical analysis showed that HM concentrations in the soil samples were generally below national limits. The mean pollution index (Pi) values for As, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn ranged from 0.94 to 1.01, while Cd and Hg exhibited slightly higher mean Pi values of 1.19 and 1.13, respectively. The Nemerow integrated pollution index values for all samples ranged from 0.71 to 4.97, with a mean of 1.26. This suggests a slight enrichment of HM above natural background levels, especially for Cd and Hg. Source apportionment using positive matrix factorization revealed that natural sources contributed the most to soil HMs (64.51 %), followed by agricultural sources (19.15 %), traffic sources (9.77 %), and industrial sources (6.57 %). The Shapley additive explanation analysis, based on the random forest model, identified soil organic carbon, deep soil HM content, altitude, total soil K2O, urbanization composite impact index, and total soil P as primary influencing factors. This indicates that the impact of transportation on roadside soils along the Beijing-Tianjin Expressway is currently relatively limited. The prominent influence of soil properties and altitude underscored the importance of “transport” and “receptor” in the soil HMs accumulation process at the local scale. These findings provide critical data and a scientific basis for decision-makers to develop policies for expressway design and roadside soil protection.",

        "Abstract": "Cloud Computing (CC) and big data are growing technology in the business. Big data is demonstrated in terms of volume, variety, and velocity. CC is employed for storing, processing, and accessing data. Many cryptographic techniques have been developed to enhance big data security in cloud computing. However, security and privacy are the primary concerns in protecting data, as it is highly sensitive. Yet, it faces the major problems of inefficient performance, increased time consumption, and lack of data confidentiality and integrity. To address this issue, proposed Extreme Learning with Projection Relational Algebraic Secured Data Transmission (ELPRA-SDT) is introduced to secure data transactions from cloud users to cloud servers with enhanced data confidentiality and reduced time consumption for big cloud data. The proposed ELPRA-SDT consists of two major processes namely registration and key generation. At first, the user's IP address is registered employing a transitive advanced set relation theory graph model in a cloud server (CS) for retrieving the numerous services. The CS generates private and public keys for each registered user's IP address using the Transitive Operational and Time Synchronized Random Winternitz Key generation model. After, the user sends a request to the CS for acquiring data. The CS validates the requested user based on security policy attributes. Second, the Projection Relational Algebraic Signcryption and Unsigncryption algorithm performs signature verification to ensure secure data access for protecting the data. Results of experiments carried out by using Coburg Intrusion Detection Data Sets-001 dataset in Java. ELPRA-SDT method is more efficient and more suitable for providing security and privacy to network traces in the Cloud. The result shows maximum performance with data confidentiality by 10% and data integrity by 13%. In addition, delay is reduced by 32%, and data delivery time and communication complexity is decreased by 28% and 24% to other existing methods.",

        "Abstract": "This paper proposes a fully decentralized approach to address the challenge of general mixed cooperation and competition within the domain of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). Conventional MARL approaches do not achieve full decentralization as they necessitate either the communication of implicit information or the retention of a centralized critic, rendering them impractical in mixed cooperative and competitive environments. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Decentralized Counterfactual Value (DCV) to model the behaviors of other agents and mitigate the non-stationary problem, accompanied by a Threat Detection (TD) mechanism to discern latent competitive or cooperative relationships. In addition, DCVTD is incorporated into both value-based and policy-based RL paradigms with theoretical convergence guarantee. Finally, empirical validation across four representative environments demonstrates the superior performance of DCVTD in terms of collective returns, computational efficiency, and agent scalability over other fully decentralized approaches, centralized training with decentralized execution approaches, and alternative approaches involving agent modeling or reward shaping in comprehensive experiments.",

        "Abstract": "Within the context of Industry 4.0, manufacturing plants implement smart technologies, which adopt machine learning and deep learning, to identify manufacturing problems and provide sensible solutions to the experts. In literature, such applications have demonstrated high-performance in terms of feature extraction and big data analysis compared to typical machine learning methods. However, in the context of control and planning, the research efforts are still focused on integrating ad-hoc solutions, e.g., heuristic algorithms and deep reinforcement learning, thus making it difficult to generate general scheduling rules for manufacturing processes that could be easily applied to a variety of stochastic manufacturing systems. To this end, this paper considers a deep learning application for addressing the scheduling optimization problem in multi-stage stochastic manufacturing environments. The aim is the formulation of a predictive model that could derive suitable authorizations for activities under uncertainty. Findings demonstrate that the proposed predictive model generates policies that improve the performance of the integrated operations within manufacturing systems, constituting to efficient and sustainable manufacturing with effective material management and near-to-zero waste.",

        "Abstract": "Recent advancements in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) have opened up vast application prospects, such as swarm control of drones, collaborative manipulation by robotic arms, and multi-target encirclement. However, potential security threats during the MARL deployment need more attention and thorough investigation. Recent research reveals that attackers can rapidly exploit the victim’s vulnerabilities, generating adversarial policies that result in the failure of specific tasks. For instance, reducing the winning rate of a superhuman-level Go AI to around 20%. Existing studies predominantly focus on two-player competitive environments, assuming attackers possess complete global state observation. In this study, we unveil, for the first time, the capability of attackers to generate adversarial policies even when restricted to partial observations of the victims in multi-agent competitive environments. Specifically, we propose a novel black-box attack (SUB-PLAY) that incorporates the concept of constructing multiple subgames to mitigate the impact of partial observability and suggests sharing transitions among subpolicies to improve attackers’ exploitative ability. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of SUB-PLAY under three typical partial observability limitations. Visualization results indicate that adversarial policies induce significantly different activations of the victims’ policy networks. Furthermore, we evaluate three potential defenses aimed at exploring ways to mitigate security threats posed by adversarial policies, providing constructive recommendations for deploying MARL in competitive environments.",

Cloud computing offers scalability and flexibility but faces challenges in energy efficiency due to the high consumption of traditional data centers. By leveraging low-resource computational clusters at the edge, we aim at reducing energy costs while meeting performance needs. A MAPPO-based scheduling policy is proposed to dynamically allocate jobs between the cloud and machines in a low-power cluster, balancing energy efficiency and scalability.

        "Abstract": "One of the main objectives of the global endeavour to achieve sustainable development is the eradication of poverty. Poverty is still a major problem, with many people across the world continuing to live in poverty and suffering despite tremendous advancements over the years. Estimating and classifying poverty levels is crucial for developing sustainable development plans and efficient policies. Robust methods for deciphering complex socioeconomic data and identifying the underlying trends and factors that contribute to poverty are provided by machine learning techniques. This chapter examines several machine learning techniques used to forecast and classify poverty levels, with a focus on achieving Sustainable Development Goal 1: the worldwide eradication of poverty in all of its forms. The current developments in model selection, data pre-processing, and feature selection that are specialized for problems related to poverty prediction are also reviewed. We are also discussing the challenges of interpretability, scalability, and data quality that arise when using machine learning models for the categorization of poverty. Our objective is to construct a system that uses machine learning approaches to assist in the creation of a precise and scalable system that predicts and classifies poverty.",

        "Abstract": "The advent of generative AI images has completely disrupted the art world. Distinguishing AI generated images from human art is a challenging problem whose impact is growing over time. A failure to address this problem allows bad actors to defraud individuals paying a premium for human art and companies whose stated policies forbid AI imagery. It is also critical for content owners to establish copyright, and for model trainers interested in curating training data in order to avoid potential model collapse. There are several different approaches to distinguishing human art from AI images, including classifiers trained by supervised learning, research tools targeting diffusion models, and identification by professional artists using their knowledge of artistic techniques. In this paper, we seek to understand how well these approaches can perform against today’s modern generative models in both benign and adversarial settings. We curate real human art across 7 styles, generate matching images from 5 generative models, and apply 8 detectors (5 automated detectors and 3 different human groups including 180 crowdworkers, 3800+ professional artists, and 13 expert artists experienced at detecting AI). Both Hive and expert artists do very well, but make mistakes in different ways (Hive is weaker against adversarial perturbations while Expert artists produce higher false positives). We believe these weaknesses will persist, and argue that a combination of human and automated detectors provides the best combination of accuracy and robustness.",

After comprehensively analyzing the influencing factors of the value of carbon emission rights from the four perspectives of macroeconomics, energy prices, climate change, policy, and the international carbon market, we integrated multi-modal influencing factor data, calculated the corresponding carbon emission costs, and combined them as the input characteristic parameter of the BP neural network, through forward propagation and backward propagation, the linear relationship between it and the value of carbon emission rights is determined, and the corresponding model is constructed to realize the value evaluation of carbon emission rights. In the test results, the fit between the carbon emission rights value assessment results and the actual transaction price has always remained relatively stable, and the specific error has always been within 0.70 yuan/ton, with the maximum error being only 0.66 yuan/ton.

        "Abstract": "Cooperation is a cornerstone of social harmony and group success. Environmental feedbacks that provide information about resource availability play a crucial role in encouraging cooperation. Previous work indicates that the impact of resource heterogeneity on cooperation depends on the incentive to act in self-interest presented by a situation, demonstrating its potential to both hinder and facilitate cooperation. However, little is known about the underlying evolutionary drivers behind this phenomenon. Leveraging agent-based modeling and game theory, we explore how differences in resource availability across environments influence the evolution of cooperation. Our results show that resource variation hinders cooperation when resources are slowly replenished but supports cooperation when resources are more readily available. Furthermore, simulations in different scenarios suggest that discerning the rate of natural selection acts on strategies under distinct evolutionary dynamics is instrumental in elucidating the intricate nexus between resource variability and cooperation. When evolutionary forces are strong, resource heterogeneity tends to work against cooperation, yet relaxed selection conditions enable it to facilitate cooperation. Inspired by these findings, we also propose a potential application in improving the performance of artificial intelligence systems through policy optimization in multi-agent reinforcement learning. These explorations promise a novel perspective in understanding the evolution of social organisms and the impact of different interactions on the function of natural systems.",

The control task of lane change becomes exceptionally complex for coordination of multiple intelligent vehicles, especially in unpredictable situations. To address this issue, the paper proposes a novel multi-intelligent vehicle lane change method (MVLC) based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). The MVLC features a hierarchical framework that includes a lower-layer lane change controller and an upper-layer reinforcement learning decision-making method. In the lower layer, a lane change controller is designed to execute motion control for a single vehicle, consisting of a lateral controller utilizing dueling double deep Q-network to make lane change decision and a longitudinal controller that employs Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) to follow the preceding vehicle. In the upper layer, a model-free DRL method is used for simultaneous control of multiple intelligent vehicles. To learn the optimal policy, a comprehensive reward function is designed. Finally, experiments are conducted in mixed traffic to valid the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results show that MVLC achieves secure and timely lane changes for multiple vehicles. Therefore, the method is expected to have significant potential for improving overall traffic efficiency and mitigating traffic congestion.",

E-learning, as an important part of blended learning, has a direct impact on students’ learning effectiveness, knowledge internalization and skill enhancement. Based on the Stimulus-Organism-Response (SOR) theory, this paper establishes a research framework for the influence factors of university students’ commitment to E-learning in the context of blended learning, and then conducts an empirical study using the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) model. The study shows that teaching resource usefulness, learning platform ease of use, and online learning environment positively affect perceived usefulness; teacher support, university policies and systems, and perceived usefulness positively affect perceived self-efficacy; and perceived self-efficacy positively affects university students’ E-learning engagement. In view of above findings, schools should strengthen teachers’ support, improve policies and systems, select and optimize teaching resources, improve the learning platform experience, and create a positive E-learning environment, as well as guide students to set up a correct concept of E-learning and enhance their perceived usefulness and perceived self-efficacy of E-learning, in order to effectively promote E-learning engagement.

We observed that complete flexibility with minimal oversight adversely impacted assignment completion rates. Seeking to strike a balance between autonomy and structure, we happened upon a policy \"sweet spot.''

However, exposure estimates may not be available in rural or mountainous areas without monitoring stations. In this study, we retrieved satellite remote sensing data for NO2, O3, and SO2 from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) L3 products. Together with ground measurements (air monitoring stations and meteorological and land use data), we estimated the monthly NO2, O3, and SO2 concentrations with a spatial resolution of 3×3 km across Taiwan from 2005 to 2019. A three-stage estimation procedure was utilized: in Stage 1, an ensemble generalized additive model (GAM) and machine learning method were used to determine the spatiotemporal variations; in Stage 2, the remote sensing data were downscaled; and in Stage 3, the downscaled concentrations were reused in the Stage 1 procedure for fine-tuning estimations. We obtained overall leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) R2 values ranging from 0.927–0.950, 0.704–0.721, and 0.601–0.716, and root-mean-square-errors (RMSEs) ranging from 1.59–2.28, 3.81–4.18, and 0.67–1.32 ppb for NO2, O3, and SO2, respectively, via the random forest procedure. The annual NO2 and SO2 concentrations greatly improved from 2005–2019, especially in the western residential area of Taiwan. However, despite these improvements in air quality, the annual O3 concentrations tended to increase from 2015–2019. This might be due to the complex mixtures of precursors (e.g., NO2), atmospheric circulation, barriers of the Central Mountain Ridge, and increasing ground temperatures over the past decade. The proposed multistage estimation procedure performed well over the whole island with complex terrain and topography. The study outcomes may provide epidemiological information for long-term ambient exposure estimates and guidance for future administrative policies.",

        "Abstract": "Shipping emissions are a major contributor to air pollution in coastal cities, and Shanghai Port, the busiest port in the world, handles over 40 million TEU annually. To mitigate shipping emissions, China introduced the Domestic Emission Control Area (DECA) policy in phases: DECA 1.0 in 2016 and DECA 2.0 in 2019. DECA 1.0 mandated low-sulfur fuels (0.5 %) at berth and near major ports, down from 1.5 %, and this requirement was extended to a 12-nautical-mile emission control zone in DECA 2.0. In this study, we conducted long-term online measurements of shipping emission tracer of vanadium (V) and nickel (Ni), at the Dian Shan Lake (DSL) supersite, located approximately 50 km from Shanghai waters. The observed V concentration exhibited a strong dependence on wind direction, with higher levels from spring to summer due to more frequent marine winds compared to other seasons. The long-term measurement showed a significant decrease in V concentrations, dropping from an annual mean of 7.08 ng m-³ during DECA 1.0 to 2.64 ng m-³ during DECA 2.0. The represents a year-on-year reduction of 63 % based on measurement. To remove the meteorological impact on the measured concentration, a Random Forest (RF) machine learning model and the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ 5.4) model were applied under a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario. Both models produced consistent results, showing a reduction of up to 82 % in V concentrations in April with more frequent marine winds, confirming regional air quality improvements post-DECA 2.0. Additionally, we found that Ni has other sources that require further control beyond shipping. The study highlights the importance of long-term measurements for understanding the impact of air quality policies on emission patterns.",

        "Abstract": "China's staple crops face heavy metal (HMs) contamination, a widespread issue lacking a national assessment. We used machine learning (ML) to assess risks of 8 HMs in rice, wheat, and maize, and estimated a financing strategy for soil remediation via linear optimization and computable general equilibrium (CGE). The accumulation of HMs in crops depends on Soil-HMs, climate, soil properties, and crop types. Cd and Hg pose major soil pollution risks, while Cr, Pb, and Cd are the most threatening in crops. High-risk zones are located at the warm temperature and subtropical zones, with wheat most vulnerable. Over a quarter (26.77 %) of the nation's croplands are classified as high-risk, with a significant 60.89 % falling into the medium-risk category, leaving merely 12.34 % of the agricultural land in a safe condition. The estimated remediation cost is 58596.73 billion RMB and the crop loss is 808.03 billion RMB in a ten-year remediation period at the context of secure crop supply. The reallocation of social investment rather than raising new taxation for the remediation is beneficial to the GDP increase and social welfare despite some loss in the household income and enterprise income. This study provides a comprehensive evaluation for Crop-HMs risk and remediation policy, crucial for national crop security.",

Our winning solution for the inaugural NeurIPS MyoChallenge leverages an approach mirroring human skill learning. Using a novel curriculum learning approach, we trained a recurrent neural network to control a realistic model of the human hand with 39 muscles to rotate two Baoding balls in the palm of the hand. In agreement with data from human subjects, the policy uncovers a small number of kinematic synergies, even though it is not explicitly biased toward low-dimensional solutions. However, selectively inactivating parts of the control signal, we found that more dimensions contribute to the task performance than suggested by traditional synergy analysis. Overall, our work illustrates the emerging possibilities at the interface of musculoskeletal physics engines, reinforcement learning, and neuroscience to advance our understanding of biological motor control.",

        "Abstract": "Collaborative behaviors in human social activities can be modeled with multi-agent reinforcement learning and used to train the collaborative policies of agents to achieve efficient cooperation. In general, agents with similar behaviors have a certain behavioral common cognition and are more likely to understand the intentions of both parties then to form cooperative policies. Traditional approaches focus on the collaborative allocation process between agents, ignoring the effects of similar behaviors and common cognition characteristics in collaborative interactions. In order to better establish collaborative relationships between agents, we propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning collaborative algorithm based on the similarity of agents’ behavioral features. In this model, the interactions of agents are established as a graph neural network. Specifically, the Pearson correlation coefficient is proposed to compute the similarity of the history trajectories of the agents as a means of determining their behavioral common cognition, which is used to establish the weights of the edges in the modeled graph neural network. In addition, we design a transformer-encoder structured state information complementation module to enhance the decision representation of the agents. The experimental results on Predator–Prey and StarCraft II show that the proposed method can effectively enhance the collaborative behaviors between agents and improve the training efficiency of collaborative models.",

        "Abstract": "Multi-agent reinforcement learning requires numerous interactions with the environment and other agents to learn an optimal policy. The teacher–student framework is one paradigm that can enhance the learning performance of reinforcement learning by allowing agents to seek advice from one another. However, recent studies show limitations in knowledge sharing between agents, as advisory learning is only peer-to-peer at a given time. Some methods enable a student to accept multiple pieces of advice, but they typically rely on pre-trained and/or policy-fixed teachers, rendering them unsuitable for agents with simultaneous advisory learning. Simultaneous learning with multiple pieces of advice has not been thoroughly investigated. Furthermore, most research has concentrated on the sharing of knowledge samples, a practice vulnerable to security breaches that could allow attackers to deduce details about the environment. To address these challenges, we propose a federated advisory framework that uses a federated learning structure to aggregate multiple sources of advice with deep reinforcement learning, ensuring that the shared advice is not sample-based. Our experimental comparisons with leading advisory learning techniques confirm that our approach significantly enhances learning performance.",

        "Abstract": "Chemical mechanisms form the core of atmospheric models to describe degradation pathways of pollutants and ultimately inform air quality and climate policymakers and other stakeholders. The accuracy of chemical mechanisms relies on the quality of their input data, which originate from experimental (laboratory, field, chamber) and theoretical (quantum chemistry, theoretical kinetics, machine learning) studies. The development of robust mechanisms requires rigorous and transparent procedures for data collection, mechanism construction and evaluation and the creation of reduced or operationally defined mechanisms. Developments in analytical techniques have led to a large number of identified chemical species in the atmospheric multiphase system that have proved invaluable for our understanding of atmospheric chemistry. At the same time, advances in software and machine learning tools have enabled automated mechanism generation. We discuss strategies for mechanism development, applying empirical or mechanistic approaches. We show the general workflows, how either approach can lead to robust mechanisms and that the two approaches complement each other, resulting in reliable predictions. Current challenges are discussed related to global change, including shifts in emission scenarios that result in new chemical regimes (e.g., low-NO scenarios, wildfires, mega- and gigacities) and that require the development of new or expanded gas- and aqueous-phase mechanisms. In addition, new mechanisms should be developed to also target oxidation capacity and aerosol chemistry impacting climate, human and ecosystem health.",

        "Abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to develop an index for measuring urban house price affordability that integrates spatial considerations and to explore the drivers of housing affordability using the post-least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) approach and the ordinary least squares method of regression analysis. Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on time-series data collected from 2005 to 2021 for 256 prefectural-level city districts in China. The new urban spatial house-to-price ratio introduced in this study adds the consideration of commuting costs due to spatial endowment compared to the traditional house-to-price ratio. And compared with the use of ordinary economic modelling methods, this study adopts the post-LASSO variable selection approach combined with the k-fold cross-test model to identify the most important drivers of housing affordability, thus better solving the problems of multicollinearity and overfitting. Findings: Urban macroeconomics environment and government regulations have varying degrees of influence on housing affordability in cities. Among them, gross domestic product is the most important influence. Research limitations/implications: The paper provides important implications for policymakers, real estate professionals and researchers. For example, policymakers will be able to design policies that target the most influential factors of housing affordability in their region. Originality/value: This study introduces a new urban spatial house price-to-income ratio, and it examines how macroeconomic indicators, government regulation, real estate market supply and urban infrastructure level have a significant impact on housing affordability. The problem of having too many variables in the decision-making process is minimized through the post-LASSO methodology, which varies the parameters of the model to allow for the ranking of the importance of the variables. As a result, this approach allows policymakers and stakeholders in the real estate market more flexibility in determining policy interventions. In addition, through the k-fold cross-validation methodology, the study ensures a high degree of accuracy and credibility when using drivers to predict housing affordability.",

        "Abstract": "Commercial vehicle parking is a significant issue in the United States. However, it is unclear why truck drivers choose to park in unauthorized areas, like ramps, rather than authorized areas. This study used INRIX big truck probe data in Maryland to explore the factors that affect truck drivers’ parking decisions. Two interpretable machine learning frameworks—SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Stable and Interpretable RUle Set (SIRUS)—were adopted to aid the research. The study finds that whether or not a designated parking lot is at capacity has a limited impact on truck drivers’ decision to park in authorized or unauthorized areas. Instead, the number of trucks parked in unauthorized areas upon a truck’s arrival is a dominant factor that triggers a decision to park in an unauthorized area, regardless of whether the parking lot is full or not. A possible explanation is the presence of trucks in unauthorized areas gives truck drivers the impression that the designated parking lot is full. Trucks with relatively longer next trip (longer than 60 miles) are more likely to park at authorized areas. Trucks with a shorter next trip are more likely to park in unauthorized areas. These trucks are probably staging, waiting for delivery windows, or avoiding peak hour traffic. The results also show that medium-weight class trucks are more likely to park in unauthorized areas than heavy trucks. Truck drivers are more likely to park in authorized areas during the mid-day and afternoon. These findings could help transportation agencies understand parking behavior and implement appropriate strategies and policies to improve truck parking.",

        "Abstract": "Background: Cancer remains a critical public health issue in India, with rising cases of breast cancer and cervical cancer. Accurate predictions and spatial analysis of cancer incidence are essential for shaping prevention strategies and targeting interventions in high-risk regions. Methods: This study utilized a big data framework employing machine learning techniques from the SparkML library to predict cancer cases and analyze spatial distributions across Indian states from 2016 to 2021. Three machine learning models used Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) were applied to the dataset. Spatial autocorrelation analysis used Moran’s I statistic to identify clustering patterns. Results: The spatial analysis revealed significant clustering of cancer cases, particularly in 2020, with a z-score of 2.23, a p-value of 0.02, and a Moran’s index of 0.15. Among the machine learning models, GWR achieved a predictive accuracy of 98% for both breast cancer and cervical cancer, while the Random Forest Regressor and Gradient Boosting Regressor achieved 95% and 97% accuracy, respectively, over the six-year period. Gradient Boosting outperformed other models in identifying key predictors and ensuring high predictive accuracy. Conclusions: The findings highlight the efficacy of Gradient Boosting and GWR in predicting cancer incidence and analyzing spatial patterns. These models provide critical insights into cancer clustering and risk factors, supporting the development of targeted prevention strategies and policy interventions for high-risk regions in India. The results emphasize the utility of machine learning techniques in public health research and cancer control.",

In this article, we reviewed the existing methods of determining intrinsic motivation based on the learned world model. The systematization of modern works in this field of study was proposed. This system consists of three classes of methods differing according to the application of the word model to the agent components of reward system, exploration policy, and intrinsic goals.

This situation led to the development of prediction models that provided predictive information about the pandemic evolution. In this paper, time series of accumulated cases of infection were generated through official data provided by the Ministry of Health of the Government of Mexico. Six deterministic and stochastic predictive models were applied to this information with the purpose of comparing its efficiency to predictive cases of infection of COVID-19. These models were applied to data from two cities in Mexico, Colima and the State of Mexico.

        "Abstract": "Research background:Big data-driven artificial Internet of Things (IoT) fintech algorithms can provide real-time personalized financial service access, strengthen risk management, and manage, monitor, and mitigate transaction operational risks by operational credit risk man-agement, suspicious financial transaction abnormal pattern detection, and synthetic financial data-based fraud simulation. Blockchain technologies, automated financial planning and investment advice services, and risk scoring and fraud detection tools can be leveraged in financial trading forecasting and planning, cryptocurrency transactions, and financial work-flow automation and fraud detection. Algorithmic trading and fraud detection tools, distributed ledger and cryptocurrency technologies, and ensemble learning and support vector machine algorithms are pivotal in predictive analytics-based risk mitigation, customer behavior and preference-based financial product and service personalization, and financial transaction and fraud detection automation. Credit scoring and risk management tools can offer financial personalized recommendations based on customer data, behavior, and preferences, in addition to transaction history, by generative adversarial and deep learning recurrent neu-ral networks. Purpose of the article: We show that blockchain and edge computing technologies, generative artificial IoT-based fintech algorithms, and transaction monitoring and credit scoring tools can be harnessed in financial decision-making processes and loan default rate mitigation for transaction, payment, and credit process efficiency. Generative and predictive artificial intelligence (AI) algorithmic trading systems can drive coherent customer service operations, provide tailored financial and investment advice, and influence financial decision processing, while performing real-time risk assessment and financial and trading risk scenario simulation across fluctuating market conditions. Fraud and money laundering prevention tools, block-chain and financial transaction technologies, and federated and decentralized machine learning algorithms can articulate algorithmic profiling-based transaction data patterns and structures, credit assessment, loan repaying likelihood prediction, and interest rate and credit lending risk management by real-time financial pattern and economic forecast-based credit analysis across investment payment and transaction record infrastructures. Methods: Research published between 2023 and 2024 was identified and analyzed across ProQuest, Scopus, and the Web of Science databases by use of screening and quality assessment software systems such as Abstrackr, AMSTAR, AXIS, CADIMA, CASP, Catchii, Distill-erSR, Eppi-Reviewer, MMAT, Nested Knowledge, PICO Portal, Rayyan, ROBIS, and SRDR+. Findings & value added: The main value added derived from the systematic literature review is that generative AI-based operational risk management, fraud detection, and transaction monitoring tools can provide personalized financial support and services and clarify financial and credit decisions and operations by financial decision-making process automation in dynamic business environments based on fraud detection capabilities and transaction data analysis and assessment. The benefits for theory and current state of the art are that credit risk and financial forecasting tools, artificial IoT-based fintech and generative AI algorithms, and algorithmic trading and distributed ledger technologies can be deployed in financial decision-making and customer behavior pattern optimization, credit score assessment, and money laundering and fraudulent payment detection. Policy implications reveal that investment management and algorithmic credit scoring tools can streamline financial activity operational efficiency, design financial planning analysis and forecasting, and carry out financial service and transaction data analysis for informed transaction decision-making and fraudulent behavior pattern and incident detection, taking into account credit history and risk evaluation and improving personalized experiences.",

        "Abstract": "Abstract: Curriculum learning in reinforcement learning utilizes a strategy that sequences simpler tasks in order to optimize the learning process for more complex problems. Typically, existing methods are categorized into two distinct approaches: one that develops a teacher (a curriculum strategy) policy concurrently with a student (a learning agent) policy, and another that utilizes selective sampling based on the student policy’s experiences across a task distribution. The main issue with the first approach is the substantial computational demand, as it requires simultaneous training of both the low-level (student) and high-level (teacher) reinforcement learning policies. On the other hand, methods based on selective sampling presuppose that the agent is capable of maximizing reward accumulation across all tasks, which may lead to complications when the primary mission is to master a specific target task. This makes those models less effective in scenarios requiring focused learning. Our research addresses a particular scenario where a teacher needs to train a new student in a new short episode. This constraint compels the teacher to rapidly master the curriculum planning by identifying the most appropriate tasks. We evaluated our framework across several complex scenarios, including a partially observable grid-world navigation environment, and in procedurally generated open-world environment Crafter.",

Detecting these activities presents significant challenges, especially when relying on remotely sensed data. This paper addresses these challenges within the framework of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which requires EU countries to enhance their environmental monitoring and climate action efforts. We used remote sensing data from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 missions to detect soil tillage practices in 73 test farms in Portugal. Three approaches were explored: a rule-based method and two machine learning techniques based on XGBoost (XGB). One machine learning approach utilized the original imbalanced dataset, while the other employed a SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) approach to balance underrepresented soil tillage operations within the training set. Our findings highlight the inherent difficulty in detecting soil tillage operations across all methods, though the XGB-SMOTE approach demonstrated the most promising results, achieving a recall of 67% and an AUC-ROC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) of 74%. These results underscore the need for further research to develop a fully automated detection model. This work has potential applications for monitoring compliance with CAP mandates and informing environmental policy to better support sustainable agricultural practices.",

        "Abstract": "“Two Mountains Theory” refers to the concept of “Lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets”. As the top-level design of ecological construction in China, this theory has been practiced for more than ten years. The importance of this theory to ecological sustainable development has been widely recognized, but the research on the ecological construction effect and its influence on soil and water conservation effect is still insufficient. By introducing the balanced scorecard, this paper constructs the evaluation index system of the construction effect of “Two Mountains Theory”, and effectively evaluates the green development effect of Kaihua County in the source area of Qiantang River from 2005 to 2020. The relationship between the practice effect of “Two Mountains Theory” and the development of soil and water control effect is further discussed by redundancy analysis. The research shows that during the 16 years of practicing the “Two Mountains Theory”, the ecological construction effect of each dimension (including economic dimension, social dimension, construction dimension and learning dimension) has shown an obvious upward trend, but the fluctuation trend and amplitude are different. The comprehensive effect of Kaihua County from 2005 to 2020 can be divided into four stages. That is to say, it stayed in a poor stage in 2005—2007, entered a qualified stage in 2008—2011, entered a good stage in 2012—2016, and entered an excellent stage in 2017—2020. In addition, the construction effects of each dimension and the comprehensive dimension are positively correlated with micro-soil erosion to a certain extent, but negatively correlated with moderate, severe and extreme soil erosion, indicating that ecological construction has effectively promoted the development of soil and water control in the study area in the process of practicing the “two mountains theory” . The results of this study provide theoretical guidance for the government to make precise policies to promote the mutual transformation between green green hills and Jinshan Yinshan, especially in the source areas of rivers with serious soil erosion.",

        "Abstract": "Urban tree canopy (UTC) coverage, or area, is an important metric for monitoring changes in UTC over large areas within a municipality. Several methods have been used to obtain these data, but remote sensing image classification is one of the fastest and most reliable over large areas. However, most studies have tested only one or two classification methods to accomplish this while using costly satellite imagery or LiDAR data. This study seeks to compare three urban tree canopy cover classifiers by testing a deep learning U-Net convolutional neural network (CNN), support vector machine learning classifier (SVM) and a random forests machine learning classifier (RF) on cost-free 2012 aerial imagery over a small southern USA city and midsize, growing southern USA city. The results of the experiment are then used to decide the best classifier and apply it to more recent aerial imagery to determine canopy changes over a 10-year period. The changes are subsequently compared visually and statistically with recent urban heat maps derived from thermal Landsat 9 satellite data to compare the means of temperatures within areas of UTC loss and no change. The U-Net CNN classifier proved to provide the best overall accuracy for both cities (89.8% and 91.4%), while also requiring the most training and classification time. When compared spatially with city heat maps, city periphery regions were most impacted by substantial changes in UTC area as cities grow and the outer regions get warmer. Furthermore, areas of UTC loss had higher temperatures than those areas with no canopy change. The broader impacts of this study reach the urban forestry managers at the local, state/province, and national levels as they seek to provide data-driven decisions for policy makers.",

        "Abstract": "[Objective] This study aimed to assess the impact of the national e-commerce demonstration cities (NEDC) pilot policy on urban carbon emission efficiency (CEE) and its underlying mechanisms. It focused on the moderating effects of e-commerce soft and hard environments, providing policy references for achieving carbon neutrality and peak carbon emissions goals. [Methods] Based on prior research, this study employed multiple-period difference-in-differences and double machine learning models to rigorously identify the causal relationship between the NEDC pilot policy and urban CEE, using panel data of 282 prefecture-level administrative units in China from 2006 to 2022. The analysis integrated the internal mechanisms of the pilot policy’s impact on CEE from supply and demand sides. This study constructed a comprehensive evaluation system of e-commerce soft and hard environments to access their moderating effects on the policy’s impact. [Results] The empirical findings reveal that the NEDC pilot policy significantly promoted urban CEE, with robust results verified through endogeneity test and multiple robustness tests. Both soft and hard environments demonstrated positive moderating effects on the policy’s impact on CEE, where network and logistics infrastructure in the hard environment played a crucial role, while technological innovation, governmental regulation and market environment in the soft environment exhibited strong moderating effects. Furthermore, the policy’s impact exhibited heterogeneity, with more pronounced effects in non-resource cities, growth-regenerative cities, and cities with higher levels of international trade. [Conclusion] To promote policy-enabled CEE, the carbon reduction effect of the pilot policy should be strengthened at both supply and demand sides. The soft and hard environments of e-commerce should be further optimized. It is recommended to advance the construction of pilot cities in an orderly manner, establish industrial e-commerce ecosystem, reinforce the coordinated optimization of soft and hard environments, and develop e-commerce according to local conditions.",
