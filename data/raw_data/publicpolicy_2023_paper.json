        "Abstract": "Background: Tracking progress and providing timely evidence is a fundamental step forward for countries to remain aligned with the targets set by WHO to eliminate cervical cancer as a public health problem (ie, to reduce the incidence of the disease below a threshold of 4 cases per 100 000 women-years). We aimed to assess the extent of global inequalities in cervical cancer incidence and mortality, based on The Global Cancer Observatory (GLOBOCAN) 2020 estimates, including geographical and socioeconomic development, and temporal aspects. Methods: For this analysis, we used the GLOBOCAN 2020 database to estimate the age-specific and age-standardised incidence and mortality rates of cervical cancer per 100 000 women-years for 185 countries or territories aggregated across the 20 UN-defined world regions, and by four-tier levels of the Human Development Index (HDI). Time trends (1988–2017) in incidence were extracted from the Cancer Incidence in Five Continents (CI5) plus database. Mortality estimates were obtained using the most recent national vital registration data from WHO. Findings: Globally in 2020, there were an estimated 604 127 cervical cancer cases and 341 831 deaths, with a corresponding age-standardised incidence of 13·3 cases per 100 000 women-years (95% CI 13·3–13·3) and mortality rate of 7·2 deaths per 100 000 women-years (95% CI 7·2–7·3). Cervical cancer incidence ranged from 2·2 (1·9–2·4) in Iraq to 84·6 (74·8–94·3) in Eswatini. Mortality rates ranged from 1·0 (0·8–1·2) in Switzerland to 55·7 (47·7–63·7) in Eswatini. Age-standardised incidence was highest in Malawi (67·9 [95% CI 65·7 –70·1]) and Zambia (65·5 [63·0–67·9]) in Africa, Bolivia (36·6 [35·0–38·2]) and Paraguay (34·1 [32·1–36·1]) in Latin America, Maldives (24·5 [17·0–32·0]) and Indonesia (24·4 [24·2–24·7]) in Asia, and Fiji (29·8 [24·7–35·0]) and Papua New Guinea (29·2 [27·3–31·0]) in Melanesia. A clear socioeconomic gradient exists in cervical cancer, with decreasing rates as HDI increased. Incidence was three times higher in countries with low HDI than countries with very high HDI, whereas mortality rates were six times higher in low HDI countries versus very high HDI countries. In 2020 estimates, a general decline in incidence was observed in most countries of the world with representative trend data, with incidence becoming stable at relatively low levels around 2005 in several high-income countries. By contrast, in the same period incidence increased in some countries in eastern Africa and eastern Europe. We observed different patterns of age-specific incidence between countries with well developed population-based screening and treatment services (eg, Sweden, Australia, and the UK) and countries with insufficient and opportunistic services (eg, Colombia, India, and Uganda). Interpretation: The burden of cervical cancer remains high in many parts of the world, and in most countries, the incidence and mortality of the disease remain much higher than the threshold set by the WHO initiative on cervical cancer elimination. We identified substantial geographical and socioeconomic inequalities in cervical cancer globally, with a clear gradient of increasing rates for countries with lower levels of human development. Our study provides timely evidence and impetus for future strategies that prioritise and accelerate progress towards the WHO elimination targets and, in so doing, address the marked variations in the global cervical cancer landscape today.

        "Abstract": "In bioethics, discussions of justice have tended to focus on questions of fairness in access to health care: is there a right to medical treatment, and how should priorities be set when medical resources are scarce. But health care is only one of many factors that determine the extent to which people live healthy lives, and fairness is not the only consideration in determining whether a health policy is just. In this pathbreaking book, senior bioethicists Powers and Faden confront foundational issues about health and justice. How much inequality in health can a just society tolerate. The audience for the book is scholars and students of bioethics and moral and political philosophy, as well as anyone interested in public health and health policy.",

        "Abstract": "The digital economy has demonstrated strong resilience and great potential, under the interwoven influence of the global pandemic and severe environmental concerns across the world. Therefore, there is a need to focus on the value of green economic growth in the digital economy. This paper constructs an evaluation index system and adopts the SEEA (System of Environmental and Economic Accounting) method to measure the digitalization level (Digi) and green economy growth level (GEG) of China. The internal mechanism and linear relationship between digitalization and green economy growth are examined based on the panel data from 2013 to 2019. Moreover, this study explores the spatial spillover effect. The major study findings are as follows: (1) Digitalization and green economy growth represent a steady growth trend, and the former as a whole significantly promotes the latter, with a marginal effect of 1.648. (2) The mechanism analysis indicates the intermediary effects’ size of three crucial intermediaries: green technology innovation > advanced industrial structure > the rationalization of industrial structure. (3) Both the “local effect” (0.556; 0.574) and “neighboring effect” (1.382; 1.415) of digitalization on green economy growth are positive under the two weight matrices and display “simultaneous resonance” characteristics based on the spatial perspective. (4) There exists obvious regional spatial heterogeneity and resource endowment heterogeneity. Finally, this study put forward corresponding policy implications, such as construction of new digital infrastructures and guiding green-energy consumption.",

        "cover_date": "2023-04-06",
        "Abstract": "A complete understanding of how exposure to environmental substances promotes cancer formation is lacking. More than 70 years ago, tumorigenesis was proposed to occur in a two-step process: an initiating step that induces mutations in healthy cells, followed by a promoter step that triggers cancer development1. Here we propose that environmental particulate matter measuring ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5), known to be associated with lung cancer risk, promotes lung cancer by acting on cells that harbour pre-existing oncogenic mutations in healthy lung tissue. Focusing on EGFR-driven lung cancer, which is more common in never-smokers or light smokers, we found a significant association between PM2.5 levels and the incidence of lung cancer for 32,957 EGFR-driven lung cancer cases in four within-country cohorts. Functional mouse models revealed that air pollutants cause an influx of macrophages into the lung and release of interleukin-1β. This process results in a progenitor-like cell state within EGFR mutant lung alveolar type II epithelial cells that fuels tumorigenesis. Ultradeep mutational profiling of histologically normal lung tissue from 295 individuals across 3 clinical cohorts revealed oncogenic EGFR and KRAS driver mutations in 18% and 53% of healthy tissue samples, respectively. These findings collectively support a tumour-promoting role for PM2.5 air pollutants and provide impetus for public health policy initiatives to address air pollution to reduce disease burden.",

        "Abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently gathered attention with the release of ChatGPT, a user-centered chatbot released by OpenAI. In this perspective article, we retrace the evolution of LLMs to understand the revolution brought by ChatGPT in the artificial intelligence (AI) field. The opportunities offered by LLMs in supporting scientific research are multiple and various models have already been tested in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks in this domain. The impact of ChatGPT has been huge for the general public and the research community, with many authors using the chatbot to write part of their articles and some papers even listing ChatGPT as an author. Alarming ethical and practical challenges emerge from the use of LLMs, particularly in the medical field for the potential impact on public health. Infodemic is a trending topic in public health and the ability of LLMs to rapidly produce vast amounts of text could leverage misinformation spread at an unprecedented scale, this could create an “AI-driven infodemic,” a novel public health threat. Policies to contrast this phenomenon need to be rapidly elaborated, the inability to accurately detect artificial-intelligence-produced text is an unresolved issue.",

        "cover_date": "2023-04-08",
        "Abstract": "Although commercial entities can contribute positively to health and society there is growing evidence that the products and practices of some commercial actors—notably the largest transnational corporations—are responsible for escalating rates of avoidable ill health, planetary damage, and social and health inequity; these problems are increasingly referred to as the commercial determinants of health. The climate emergency, the non-communicable disease epidemic, and that just four industry sectors (ie, tobacco, ultra-processed food, fossil fuel, and alcohol) already account for at least a third of global deaths illustrate the scale and huge economic cost of the problem. This paper, the first in a Series on the commercial determinants of health, explains how the shift towards market fundamentalism and increasingly powerful transnational corporations has created a pathological system in which commercial actors are increasingly enabled to cause harm and externalise the costs of doing so. Consequently, as harms to human and planetary health increase, commercial sector wealth and power increase, whereas the countervailing forces having to meet these costs (notably individuals, governments, and civil society organisations) become correspondingly impoverished and disempowered or captured by commercial interests. This power imbalance leads to policy inertia; although many policy solutions are available, they are not being implemented. Health harms are escalating, leaving health-care systems increasingly unable to cope. Governments can and must act to improve, rather than continue to threaten, the wellbeing of future generations, development, and economic growth.",

        "Abstract": "While versatile application of plastics has generated huge benefits in our life, the ‘plastic end-of-life’ comes with downsides of emerging concern is plastic particles within all parts of environments. Plastics are highly resistant to degradation and sustain in the environment for a prolonged period resulting in easy access of microplastics into human food chain. Microplastic exposure to humans is caused by foods of both animal and plant origin, food additives, drinks, and plastic food packaging. Living organisms can accumulate microplastics in cells and tissues which results in threats of chronic biological effects and potential health hazards for humans including body gastrointestinal disorders, immunity, respiratory problem, cancer, infertility, and alteration in chromosomes. Because of the threat of microplastics on human health, it is essential to ensure food safety as well as control plastic use with strict regulation of proper management. This study aims to enlighten future research into the core component of microplastics, their exposure to human food, prevention to human food chain, and biological reactions in human body. Finally, it is recommended to consider the presence of microplastics in different foods, as most of the existing research mainly focused on sea foods. And it is important to study the mechanism of toxicity with pathways in the human body based on the different types, shapes, and sizes of plastic particles.",

Since the advent of tools based on recent advancement in artificial intelligence (AI), educators have made major strides in applying state-of-the-art technologies to writing classrooms. In November 2022, an AI-powered chatbot named ChatGPT capable of automatic text generation was introduced to the public. The study tried to apply ChatGPT’s text generation feature in a one-week L2 writing practicum. The study adopted a qualitative approach to investigate students’ behaviors and reflections in their exposure to ChatGPT in writing classrooms. The developmental features in learning activities and reflective perceptions were triangulated for the piloting evaluation of the impact of ChatGPT on L2 writing learners. The findings revealed the affordance and potential applicability of the tool in L2 writing pedagogy. Additionally, the tool also showcased an automatic workflow that could maximize the efficiency in composing writing. However, participants generally expressed their concern with its threats to academic honesty and educational equity. The study impelled the reconceptualization of plagiarism in the new era, development of regulatory policies and pedagogical guidance to regulate proper utilization of the tool. Being a pioneering effort, the study accentuated future research directions for more insights into the application of ChatGPT in L2 learning, and the establishment of corresponding pedagogical adjustments.",

        "Abstract": "Terahertz (THz) radiation encompasses a wide spectral range within the electromagnetic spectrum that extends from microwaves to the far infrared (100 GHz-∼30 THz). Within its frequency boundaries exist a broad variety of scientific disciplines that have presented, and continue to present, technical challenges to researchers. During the past 50 years, for instance, the demands of the scientific community have substantially evolved and with a need for advanced instrumentation to support radio astronomy, Earth observation, weather forecasting, security imaging, telecommunications, non-destructive device testing and much more. Furthermore, applications have required an emergence of technology from the laboratory environment to production-scale supply and in-the-field deployments ranging from harsh ground-based locations to deep space. In addressing these requirements, the research and development community has advanced related technology and bridged the transition between electronics and photonics that high frequency operation demands. The multidisciplinary nature of THz work was our stimulus for creating the 2017 THz Science and Technology Roadmap (Dhillon et al 2017 J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 50 043001). As one might envisage, though, there remains much to explore both scientifically and technically and the field has continued to develop and expand rapidly. It is timely, therefore, to revise our previous roadmap and in this 2023 version we both provide an update on key developments in established technical areas that have important scientific and public benefit, and highlight new and emerging areas that show particular promise. The developments that we describe thus span from fundamental scientific research, such as THz astronomy and the emergent area of THz quantum optics, to highly applied and commercially and societally impactful subjects that include 6G THz communications, medical imaging, and climate monitoring and prediction. Our Roadmap vision draws upon the expertise and perspective of multiple international specialists that together provide an overview of past developments and the likely challenges facing the field of THz science and technology in future decades. The document is written in a form that is accessible to policy makers who wish to gain an overview of the current state of the THz art, and for the non-specialist and curious who wish to understand available technology and challenges. A such, our experts deliver a ‘snapshot’ introduction to the current status of the field and provide suggestions for exciting future technical development directions. Ultimately, we intend the Roadmap to portray the advantages and benefits of the THz domain and to stimulate further exploration of the field in support of scientific research and commercial realisation.",

        "cover_date": "2023-02-01",
        "Abstract": "Climate warming is considered to be among the most serious of anthropogenic stresses to the environment, because it not only has direct effects on biodiversity, but it also exacerbates the harmful effects of other human-mediated threats. The associated consequences are potentially severe, particularly in terms of threats to species preservation, as well as in the preservation of an array of ecosystem services provided by biodiversity. Among the most affected groups of animals are insects—central components of many ecosystems—for which climate change has pervasive effects from individuals to communities. In this contribution to the scientists' warning series, we summarize the effect of the gradual global surface temperature increase on insects, in terms of physiology, behavior, phenology, distribution, and species interactions, as well as the effect of increased frequency and duration of extreme events such as hot and cold spells, fires, droughts, and floods on these parameters. We warn that, if no action is taken to better understand and reduce the action of climate change on insects, we will drastically reduce our ability to build a sustainable future based on healthy, functional ecosystems. We discuss perspectives on relevant ways to conserve insects in the face of climate change, and we offer several key recommendations on management approaches that can be adopted, on policies that should be pursued, and on the involvement of the general public in the protection effort.",

This study aimed to examine cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of trust in government regarding COVID-19 control with the adoption of recommended health behaviours and prosocial behaviours, and potential determinants of trust in government during the pandemic. Methods This study analysed data from the PsyCorona Survey, an international project on COVID-19 that included 23 733 participants from 23 countries (representative in age and gender distributions by country) at baseline survey and 7785 participants who also completed follow-up surveys. Specification curve analysis was used to examine concurrent associations between trust in government and self-reported behaviours. We further used structural equation model to explore potential determinants of trust in government. Multilevel linear regressions were used to examine associations between baseline trust and longitudinal behavioural changes. Results Higher trust in government regarding COVID-19 control was significantly associated with higher adoption of health behaviours (handwashing, avoiding crowded space, self-quarantine) and prosocial behaviours in specification curve analyses (median standardised β = 0.173 and 0.229, p < 0.001). Government perceived as well organised, disseminating clear messages and knowledge on COVID-19, and perceived fairness were positively associated with trust in government (standardised β = 0.358, 0.230, 0.056, and 0.249, p < 0.01). Higher trust at baseline survey was significantly associated with lower rate of decline in health behaviours over time (p for interaction = 0.001). Conclusions These results highlighted the importance of trust in government in the control of COVID-19.",

        "Abstract": "Study Question: What is the recommended assessment and management of those with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), based on the best available evidence, clinical expertise, and consumer preference? Summary Answer: International evidence-based guidelines address prioritized questions and outcomes and include 254 recommendations and practice points, to promote consistent, evidence-based care and improve the experience and health outcomes in PCOS. What is Known Already: The 2018 International PCOS Guideline was independently evaluated as high quality and integrated multidisciplinary and consumer perspectives from six continents; it is now used in 196 countries and is widely cited. It was based on best available, but generally very low to low quality, evidence. It applied robust methodological processes and addressed shared priorities. The guideline transitioned from consensus based to evidence-based diagnostic criteria and enhanced accuracy of diagnosis, whilst promoting consistency of care. However, diagnosis is still delayed, the needs of those with PCOS are not being adequately met, evidence quality was low and evidence-practice gaps persist. Study Design, Size, Duration: The 2023 International Evidence-based Guideline update reengaged the 2018 network across professional societies and consumer organizations with multidisciplinary experts and women with PCOS directly involved at all stages. Extensive evidence synthesis was completed. Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation-II (AGREEII)-compliant processes were followed. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was applied across evidence quality, feasibility, acceptability, cost, implementation and ultimately recommendation strength and diversity and inclusion were considered throughout. Participants/Materials, Setting, Methods: This summary should be read in conjunction with the full Guideline for detailed participants and methods. Governance included a six-continent international advisory and management committee, five guideline development groups, and paediatric, consumer, and translation committees. Extensive consumer engagement and guideline experts informed the update scope and priorities. Engaged international society-nominated panels included paediatrics, endocrinology, gynaecology, primary care, reproductive endocrinology, obstetrics, psychiatry, psychology, dietetics, exercise physiology, obesity care, public health and other experts, alongside consumers, project management, evidence synthesis, statisticians and translation experts. Thirty-nine professional and consumer organizations covering 71 countries engaged in the process. Twenty meetings and five face-to-face forums over 12 months addressed 58 prioritized clinical questions involving 52 systematic and 3 narrative reviews. Evidence-based recommendations were developed and approved via consensus across five guideline panels, modified based on international feedback and peer review, independently reviewed for methodological rigour, and approved by the Australian Government National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC). Main Results and the Role of Chance: The evidence in the assessment and management of PCOS has generally improved in the past five years, but remains of low to moderate quality. The technical evidence report and analyses (∼6000 pages) underpins 77 evidence-based and 54 consensus recommendations, with 123 practice points. Key updates include: i) further refinement of individual diagnostic criteria, a simplified diagnostic algorithm and inclusion of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels as an alternative to ultrasound in adults only; ii) strengthening recognition of broader features of PCOS including metabolic risk factors, cardiovascular disease, sleep apnea, very high prevalence of psychological features, and high risk status for adverse outcomes during pregnancy; iii) emphasizing the poorly recognized, diverse burden of disease and the need for greater healthcare professional education, evidence-based patient information, improved models of care and shared decision making to improve patient experience, alongside greater research; iv) maintained emphasis on healthy lifestyle, emotional wellbeing and quality of life, with awareness and consideration of weight stigma; and v) emphasizing evidence-based medical therapy and cheaper and safer fertility management. Limitations, Reasons for Caution: Overall, recommendations are strengthened and evidence is improved, but remain generally low to moderate quality. Significantly greater research is now needed in this neglected, yet common condition. Regional health system variation was considered and acknowledged, with a further process for guideline and translation resource adaptation provided. Wider Implications of the Findings: The 2023 International Guideline for the Assessment and Management of PCOS provides clinicians and patients with clear advice on best practice, based on the best available evidence, expert multidisciplinary input and consumer preferences. Research recommendations have been generated and a comprehensive multifaceted dissemination and translation programme supports the Guideline with an integrated evaluation program.

        "Abstract": "Objectives We aimed to provide the most updated estimates on the global burden of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to improve management strategies. Design We extracted data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 database to evaluate IBD burden with different measures in 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2019. Setting Studies from the GBD 2019 database generated by population-representative data sources identified through a literature review and research collaborations were included. Participants Patients with an IBD diagnosis. Outcomes Total numbers, age-standardised rates of prevalence, mortality and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and their estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) were the main outcomes. Results In 2019, there were approximately 4.9 million cases of IBD worldwide, with China and the USA having the highest number of cases (911 405 and 762 890 (66.9 and 245.3 cases per 100 000 people, respectively)). Between 1990 and 2019, the global age-standardised rates of prevalence, deaths and DALYs decreased (EAPCs=-0.66,-0.69 and -1.04, respectively). However, the age-standardised prevalence rate increased in 13 out of 21 GBD regions. A total of 147 out of 204 countries or territories experienced an increase in the age-standardised prevalence rate. From 1990 to 2019, IBD prevalent cases, deaths and DALYs were higher among females than among males. A higher Socio-demographic Index was associated with higher age-standardised prevalence rates. Conclusions IBD will continue to be a major public health burden due to increasing numbers of prevalent cases, deaths and DALYs. The epidemiological trends and disease burden of IBD have changed dramatically at the regional and national levels, so understanding these changes would be beneficial for policy makers to tackle IBD.",

        "Abstract": "The review comprehensively examines hybrid renewable energy systems that combine solar and wind energy technologies, focusing on their current challenges, opportunities, and policy implications. Despite the individual merits of solar and wind energy systems, their intermittent nature and geographical limitations have spurred interest in hybrid solutions that maximize efficiency and reliability through integrated systems. A critical analysis of available literature indicates that hybrid systems significantly mitigate energy intermittency issues, enhance grid stability, and can be more cost-effective due to shared infrastructure. The review identifies key challenges, such as system optimization, energy storage, and seamless power management, and discusses technological innovations like machine learning algorithms and advanced inverters that hold the potential for overcoming these hurdles. Importantly, the review elucidates the role of policy in accelerating the adoption of these systems by highlighting successful case studies of government incentives, public-private partnerships, and regulatory frameworks that have fostered investments in hybrid renewable energy systems. The study concludes with the outcomes obtained that signify the potential for hybrid renewable energy systems to not only meet but exceed future energy demands sustainably, provided there is concerted effort in research, investment, and policy-making.",

        "cover_date": "2023-09-05",
        "Abstract": "An influential line of thinking in behavioral science, to which the two authors have long subscribed, is that many of society's most pressing problems can be addressed cheaply and effectively at the level of the individual, without modifying the system in which the individual operates. We now believe this was a mistake, along with, we suspect, many colleagues in both the academic and policy communities. Results from such interventions have been disappointingly modest. But more importantly, they have guided many (though by no means all) behavioral scientists to frame policy problems in individual, not systemic, terms: To adopt what we call the i-frame, rather than the s-frame. The difference may be more consequential than i-frame advocates have realized, by deflecting attention and support away from s-frame policies. Indeed, highlighting the i-frame is a long-established objective of corporate opponents of concerted systemic action such as regulation and taxation. We illustrate our argument briefly for six policy problems, and in depth with the examples of climate change, obesity, retirement savings, and pollution from plastic waste. We argue that the most important way in which behavioral scientists can contribute to public policy is by employing their skills to develop and implement value-creating system-level change.",

        "Abstract": "The global community is concerned about several environmental changes. Climate change, desertification, destruction of tropical rainforests, erosion of coastal ecosystems, soil resource loss, overfishing, species extinction, and loss of biodiversity are all contributing factors. Many commentators contend that these issues make up a cumulative, sustained human impact on the environment that has profoundly changed the surface of the Earth. We explore the effects of alternative energy sources, natural resources, and government consumption expenditures on French environmental sustainability from 1990 through 2018 under the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) framework. We apply advanced econometric methodologies for empirical analysis. Our long-run estimates indicate that alternative and nuclear energy, natural resources, and government final consumption expenditures are negatively associated with CO2 emissions, while economic growth is positively related to CO2 emissions. CO2 emissions are negatively correlated with the square root of economic growth (EKC), thereby supporting EKC. As economic growth increases, environmental sustainability deteriorates. Eventually, EKC will make a positive contribution to environmental improvement. Future research directions, research limitations, and policy implications are discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Postwar Beirut conjures up contradictory images of remarkable openness and inconceivable violence, of great antiquity and a bright future. The Lebanese capital stands for Arab cosmopolitanism and cultural effervescence but also for its tragedies of destruction. This book examines the historical formation of Beirut as a multiply contested Mediterranean city. Fin de Siècle Beirut is a landmark contribution to the growing literature in Ottoman studies, in Arab cultural history and on Mediterranean cities. Combining urban theory, particularly Henri Lefebvre’s work on cities and capitalism, with postcolonial methodology, the central thesis of this book is that modern Beirut is the outcome of persistent social and intellectual struggles over the production of space. The city of Beirut was at once the product, the object, and the project of imperial and urban politics of difference: overlapping European, Ottoman, and municipal civilising missions competed in the political fields of administration, infrastructure, urban planning, public health, education, public morality, journalism, and architecture. Jens Hanssen offers a comprehensive, original account of the emergence of modern Beirut out of an economic shift away from Acre in the wake of the Napoleonic wars. He argues that the Ottoman government’s decision to heed calls for the creation of a new province around Beirut and grant it provincial capital status in 1888 paved the way for fundamental urban and regional reconfigurations long before colonial policies during the French Mandate period. This new Ottoman province came to constitute the territorial embodiment of regional self-determination for Arab nationalists in Beirut until the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire after World War I. Drawing on published and unpublished Ottoman government documents, Arabic sources, and European archival material, Hanssen’s book traces the urban experience of modernity in the Ottoman Empire. The transformation of everyday life in late nineteenth-century Beirut and the concomitant policies of urban management is vividly set against the devastating civil war in Mount Lebanon and Damascus in 1860.",

        "Abstract": "Background: Environmental Social Governance (ESG) investment had entered a phase of rapid development in the past few decades as most nations had put forward “carbon neutral” initiatives. ESG would receive more attention from the industry and academia in a global environment full of uncertainties. Companies benefit from the sharing of ESG data by improving their brand image, which attracts funding, lowers financing costs, and increases valuation. Purpose: To explore how ESG drives corporate financial performance. Also, the research examines the interrelation of ESG presentation and corporate presentation. Design: /methodology/approach: Over an interval of 10 years (2011–2020) using a sample of 3332 listed organizations worldwide. The theory of the research is on the basis of stakeholder and transmitting signal theory and multiple regression and categorized regression were applied with STATA 16.0 software. Results: The study utilizes a large dataset of 24,076 valid observations, providing robust statistical power for the analysis. The study findings proved that ESG performance is positively interrelated with corporate performance (p < 0.01). According to the findings of the study, at 1% of the level related to significance (p < 0.01), the regression coefficient for ESG is considerably positive. Thus, the influence of ESG rating on corporate performance is significant for large-scale companies and insignificant for small-scale companies. The results demonstrate that the positive impact of ESG rating on corporate financial performance is more pronounced in the high risk case than in the low risk case (p < 0.01). The results highlight the importance of ESG performance in today's world. Overall, the study gives precious perception about the interrelation between ESG and corporate financial performance (CFP). Policy implications: The researchers believe that the results of this study are beneficial to companies and governments in the development of environmentally conscious industries since they demonstrate corporate success through ESG. More realistically, the ESG can boost corporate firm performance by enabling businesses to maintain sustainability, establish a solid reputation, win the trust of stakeholders, and contribute to solving national sustainable development issues. Additionally, the researchers believe that the results of this study can boost management effectiveness, which in turn can help firms succeed. Originality/value: In the context of environmentally sensitive industries, this study findings provide empirical insights to the association between the corporate firms success and ESG performance. In addition, the findings provide insights to the business organizations development and the significance of ESG integration in the business organizations.",

        "Abstract": "Background: Physical inactivity is an important modifiable risk factor for non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and mental health conditions. We aimed to estimate the public health-care costs associated with these diseases because of physical inactivity, which will help policy makers to prioritise investment in policy actions to promote and enable more people to be more active. Methods: We used a population-attributable fraction formula to estimate the direct public health-care costs of NCDs and mental health conditions for 2020–30. The disease outcomes that we included were incident cases of coronary heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cancer (breast, colon, bladder, endometrial, oesophageal, gastric, and renal), dementia, and depression in adults aged at least 18 years. We used the most recent health and economic data evidence available for 194 countries. Findings: 499·2 million new cases of preventable major NCDs would occur globally by 2030 if the prevalence of physical inactivity does not change, with direct health-care costs of INT$520 billion. The global cost of inaction on physical inactivity would reach approximately $47·6 billion per year. Although 74% of new cases of NCDs would occur in low-income and middle-countries, high-income countries would bear a larger proportion (63%) of the economic costs. The cost of treatment and management of NCDs varied—although dementia accounted for only 3% of new preventable NCDs, the disease corresponded to 22% of all costs; type 2 diabetes accounted for 2% of new preventable cases but 9% of all costs; and cancers accounted for 1% of new preventable cases but 15% of all costs. Interpretation: This health and economic burden of physical inactivity is avoidable. Further investments in and implementation of known and effective policy interventions will support countries to reach the Sustainable Development Goal of reduction of NCD mortality by 2030.

        "cover_date": "2023-06-01",
        "Abstract": "Background: The recently published Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) for the treatment of stages I–IV periodontitis provided evidence-based recommendations for treating periodontitis patients, defined according to the 2018 classification. Peri-implant diseases were also re-defined in the 2018 classification. It is well established that both peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis are highly prevalent. In addition, peri-implantitis is particularly challenging to manage and is accompanied by significant morbidity. Aim: To develop an S3 level CPG for the prevention and treatment of peri-implant diseases, focusing on the implementation of interdisciplinary approaches required to prevent the development of peri-implant diseases or their recurrence, and to treat/rehabilitate patients with dental implants following the development of peri-implant diseases. Materials and Methods: This S3 level CPG was developed by the European Federation of Periodontology, following methodological guidance from the Association of Scientific Medical Societies in Germany and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation process. A rigorous and transparent process included synthesis of relevant research in 13 specifically commissioned systematic reviews, evaluation of the quality and strength of evidence, formulation of specific recommendations, and a structured consensus process involving leading experts and a broad base of stakeholders. Results: The S3 level CPG for the prevention and treatment of peri-implant diseases culminated in the recommendation for implementation of various different interventions before, during and after implant placement/loading. Prevention of peri-implant diseases should commence when dental implants are planned, surgically placed and prosthetically loaded. Once the implants are loaded and in function, a supportive peri-implant care programme should be structured, including periodical assessment of peri-implant tissue health. If peri-implant mucositis or peri-implantitis are detected, appropriate treatments for their management must be rendered. Conclusion: The present S3 level CPG informs clinical practice, health systems, policymakers and, indirectly, the public on the available and most effective modalities to maintain healthy peri-implant tissues, and to manage peri-implant diseases, according to the available evidence at the time of publication.",

However, vaccine hesitancy remains a public health threat, which is still common among healthcare workers (HCWs). This systematic review aimed to synthesise evidence on HCWs' attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination and analyse associated factors to provide information for vaccine policy development and practice.We searched PubMed, Embase, ScienceDirect,Web of Science and three Chinese databases for literature published on 12 February 2021. Two researchers screened the literature independently, and 13 studies were included in the systematic review. Vaccine acceptance varied widely and ranged from27.7% to 77.3%.HCWs had positive attitudes towards future COVID-19 vaccines,while vaccine hesitancy was still common. Demographic variables such as men, older age and physicians were positive predictive factors. Women and nurses had more vaccine hesitancy. Previous influenza vaccination and self-perceived risk were facilitators. Concerns for safety, efficacy and effectiveness and distrust of the governmentwere barriers. Influences of direct (COVID-19) patient care towards vaccination intentionwere less conclusive. Tailored communication strategieswere needed to increase the uptake rate of COVID-19 vaccines among HCWs. More importantly,more data and information on the safety and efficacy of vaccines should be provided with transparency.",

        "Abstract": "The decarbonization of industry and industrial systems is a pressing challenge given the relative lack of low-carbon options available for “hard to decarbonize” sectors such as steelmaking, cement manufacturing, and chemical production. Carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS) represents a promising and crosscutting solution to this formidable problem. This review takes a systematic and sociotechnical perspective to examine how CCUS can support industrial decarbonization and relevant associated technical, economic, and social factors. This includes a focus on the energy and climate impacts of carbon emitting activities, the role, and options for CCUS in global responses to climate change, technical aspects of capture, transport, storage, and utilization, as well as policy implications and areas requiring further research. In doing so, the Review examines hundreds of published studies on the topic over the previous twenty years to offer a state-of-the-art investigation on technical options for capture (including direct air capture), transportation (including pipelines, ships, and rail), storage (including biotic and abiotic), and utilization (including enhanced oil recovery and biochar). The Review also investigates the evidence base within the literature on enablers and barriers to CCUS, policy mechanisms, and international frameworks as well as themes such as geopolitics, trade, and future research gaps. We conclude with insights about future CCUS pathways and sociotechnical systems dynamics.",

Fostering interlinked human, ecosystem, and planetary health for a livable future urgently requires bold implementation of transformative policy interventions through interconnected institutions, governance, and social systems from local to global levels.",

        "Abstract": "Background: Synthesising evidence on the long-term vaccine effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines (BNT162b2 [Pfizer–BioNTech], mRNA-1273 [Moderna], ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 [AZD1222; Oxford–AstraZeneca], and Ad26.COV2.S [Janssen]) against infections, hospitalisations, and mortality is crucial to making evidence-based pandemic policy decisions. Methods: In this rapid living systematic evidence synthesis and meta-analysis, we searched EMBASE and the US National Institutes of Health's iSearch COVID-19 Portfolio, supplemented by manual searches of COVID-19-specific sources, until Dec 1, 2022, for studies that reported vaccine effectiveness immediately and at least 112 days after a primary vaccine series or at least 84 days after a booster dose. Single reviewers assessed titles, abstracts, and full-text articles, and extracted data, with a second reviewer verifying included studies. The primary outcomes were vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infections, hospitalisations, and mortality, which were assessed using three-level meta-analytic models. This study is registered with the National Collaborating Centre for Methods and Tools, review 473. Findings: We screened 16 696 records at the title and abstract level, appraised 832 (5·0%) full texts, and initially included 73 (0·4%) studies. Of these, we excluded five (7%) studies because of critical risk of bias, leaving 68 (93%) studies that were extracted for analysis. For infections caused by any SARS-CoV-2 strain, vaccine effectiveness for the primary series reduced from 83% (95% CI 80–86) at baseline (14–42 days) to 62% (53–69) by 112–139 days. Vaccine effectiveness at baseline was 92% (88–94) for hospitalisations and 91% (85–95) for mortality, and reduced to 79% (65–87) at 224–251 days for hospitalisations and 86% (73–93) at 168–195 days for mortality. Estimated vaccine effectiveness was lower for the omicron variant for infections, hospitalisations, and mortality at baseline compared with that of other variants, but subsequent reductions occurred at a similar rate across variants. For booster doses, which covered mostly omicron studies, vaccine effectiveness at baseline was 70% (56–80) against infections and 89% (82–93) against hospitalisations, and reduced to 43% (14–62) against infections and 71% (51–83) against hospitalisations at 112 days or later. Not enough studies were available to report on booster vaccine effectiveness against mortality. Interpretation: Our analyses indicate that vaccine effectiveness generally decreases over time against SARS-CoV-2 infections, hospitalisations, and mortality. The baseline vaccine effectiveness levels for the omicron variant were notably lower than for other variants. Therefore, other preventive measures (eg, face-mask wearing and physical distancing) might be necessary to manage the pandemic in the long term.

        "Abstract": "In recent years, there has been mounting concern about the bearing of microplastics on human health and the comprehensive natural environment. These particles come from a variety of sources, such as soaps, personal care products, and the rundown of bigger plastic items. The impacts of microplastics on marine life and other ecosystems are substantial, including ingestion by marine animals, interference with their reproductive systems, and even death. The economic implications of microplastics are also significant, with industries, such as fishing and tourism being affected by the presence of microplastics in the environment. Exposure to microplastics can also pose potential health risks to humans, including respiratory and digestive problems, as well as disrupt sleep, contribute to obesity, and increase the risk of diabetes. To address this issue, policies and initiatives have been put in place to reduce microplastic pollution, but there are challenges that need to be overcome, such as lack of awareness, limited resources, and ineffective regulations. Further research is also needed to fully understand the impacts of microplastics on our health and to develop effective strategies to mitigate the problem. In this article, we have discussed the requirement of a multifaceted approach including reducing plastic use, promoting proper disposal and recycling of plastic waste, developing innovative technologies for capturing and removing microplastics from the environment, raising public awareness, and implementing effective regulations and policies. It is only through concerted efforts and collaboration between individuals, industries, and governments that the threat of microplastics can be tackled.",

        "Abstract": "Promoting the synergy of pollution control (PC) and carbon reduction (CR) is an important strategy for ecological civilization construction in China. Based on constructing a measuring system for PC and CR respectively, we employ the coupling coordination model to determine the coupling coordination degree (CCD) between PC and CR in 30 Chinese provinces during 2006–2019, and analyze the spatial–temporal characteristics, regional differences, and convergence of the CCD between PC and CR from a dual perspective of east–west and south–north regional divisions. The results show that the average CCD between PC and CR increases from 0.8339 in 2006 to 0.8904 in 2019, suggesting that the two subsystems are in a well-coordinated stage. Moreover, China's CCD shows a “high in the east and low in the west, high in the south and low in the north” layout and exhibits a prominent spatial positive autocorrelation characteristic. Furthermore, the overall regional differences in the CCD of each province show an increasing trend initially, followed by a decreasing trend. The overall differences in east–west and south–north originate primarily from the cross-regional and within-regional difference, respectively. The results of the convergence model show that there is no σ convergence of China's CCD, while there exists β convergence in China and different regions. These findings provide empirical evidence and policy implications for facilitating the synergistic effect of PC and CR.",

Public management of a country's mineral resource potential is seen as an element of transnational governance which provides for the use of laws, rules and regulations within the jurisdictional and sectoral capabilities of the state, minimising its involvement as a producer of minerals. The features of the ideology of economic liberalism, which polarises the societies of mineral-producing countries and denies the role of the state as a market participant, have been studied. The analysis of the influence of the radical new order of neoliberal world ideology on the development of the extractive sector and state regulation has been presented.",

        "citied_by": "134",
        "cover_date": "2023-05-31",
        "Abstract": "Objectives: Pandemics and their public health control measures have generally substantially increased the level of loneliness and social isolation in the general population. Because of the circumstances of aging, older adults are more likely to experience social isolation and loneliness during pandemics. However, no systematic review has been conducted or published on the prevalence of loneliness and/or social isolation among the older population. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to provide up-to-date pooled estimates of the prevalence of social isolation and loneliness among older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic and other pandemics in the last two decades. Design: EMBASE, PsychoINFO, Medline, and Web of Science were searched for relevant studies from January 1, 2000 to November 31, 2021 published in a variety of languages. Only studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic were selected in the review. Results: A total of 30 studies including 28,050 participants met the inclusion criteria. Overall, the pooled period prevalence of loneliness among older adults was 28.6% (95% CI: 22.9-35.0%) and 31.2% for social isolation (95% CI: 20.2-44.9%). Prevalence estimates were significantly higher for those studies conducted post 3-month from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to those conducted within the first 3 months of the pandemic. Conclusions: This review identifies the need for good quality longitudinal studies to examine the long-term impact of pandemics on loneliness and social isolation among older populations. Health policymaking and healthcare systems should proactively address the rising demand for appropriate psychological services among older adults.",

        "Abstract": "Tourism industry significantly enhances consumption, creates employment, and becomes a new engine of economic growth worldwide. However, tourism-led growth is attained at the cost of environmental damages, as tourism-related activities require higher energy consumption. We also included globalization, energy consumption, and economic growth to normalize the tourism industry sub-sectors environmental impacts. The ARDL bound testing and Gradual shift causality methods are used to analyze the environmental impacts of the tourism industry for the data spanning from 2001Q1 to 2019Q4. The outcomes indicate that tourism-related food and beverage services contribute to higher greenhouse gas emissions, especially N2O and CH4. However, compared with other sub-sectors, CO2 is primarily contributed by the tourism-traveling sector in the long run. Similarly, the food and beverages services also contribute highly to all air pollutants except PM2.5, while shopping and entertainment is the most significant sector contributing to N2O, CH4, and all other air pollutants in the long run. Moreover, all tourism industry sub-sectors have a significant and favorable impact on energy consumption and economic growth, whereas tourism-linked traveling consumes higher energy. Likewise, shopping and entertainment contribute more to economic growth than other sub-sectors. Interestingly, greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutants are adversely affected by globalization in the long run. Causality results reveal that all the tourism industry sub-sectors Granger cause most of the greenhouse gasses and air pollutants. The key initiatives are also provided for policy implications.",

        "Abstract": "False data published by a psychologist influence policies for treating the mentally retarded. A Nobel Prize-winning molecular biologist resigns the presidency of Rockefeller University in the wake of a scandal involving a co-author accused of fabricating data. A university investigating committee declares that almost half the published articles of a promising young radiologist are fraudulent. Incidents like these strike at the heart of the scientific enterprise and shake the confidence of a society accustomed to thinking of scientists as selfless seekers of truth. Marcel LaFollette's long-awaited book gives a penetrating examination of the world of scientific publishing in which such incidents of misconduct take place. Because influential scientific journals have been involved in the controversies, LaFollette focuses on the fragile \"peer review\" process-the editorial system of seeking pre-publication opinions from experts. She addresses the cultural glorification of science, which, combined with a scientist's thirst for achievement, can seem to make cheating worth the danger. She describes the great risks taken by the accusers-often scholars of less prestige and power than the accused-whom she calls \"nemesis figures\" for their relentless dedication to uncovering dishonesty. In sober warning, LaFollette notes that impatient calls from Congress, journalists, and taxpayers for greater accountability from scientists have important implications for the entire system of scientific research and communication. Provocative and learned, Stealing Into Print is certain to become the authoritative work on scientific fraud, invaluable to the scientific community, policy makers, and the general public.",

        "Abstract": "Background & Aims: The prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasing. We aimed to estimate the pooled global NAFLD incidence. Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies of adults without NAFLD at baseline to evaluate the global incidence of ultrasound-diagnosed NAFLD. Results: A total of 63 eligible studies (1,201,807 persons) were analyzed. Studies were from Mainland China/Hong Kong (n = 26), South Korea (n = 22), Japan (n = 14), other (n = 2, Sri Lanka, Israel); 63.8% were clinical center studies; median study year 2000 to 2016; 87% were good quality. Among the 1,201,807 persons at risk, 242,568 persons developed NAFLD, with an incidence rate of 4,612.8 (95% CI 3,931.5-5,294.2) per 100,000 person-years and no statistically significant differences by study sample size (p = 0.90) or study setting (p = 0.055). Males had higher incidence vs. females (5,943.8 vs. 3,671.7, p = 0.0013). Both the obese (vs. non-obese) and the overweight/obese groups (vs. normal weight) were about threefold more likely to develop NAFLD (8,669.6 vs. 2,963.9 and 8,416.6 vs. 3,358.2, respectively) (both p <0.0001). Smokers had higher incidence than non-smokers (8,043.2 vs. 4,689.7, p = 0.046). By meta-regression, adjusting for study year, study setting, and study location, study period of 2010 or after and study setting were associated with increased incidence (p = 0.010 and p = 0.055, respectively). By country, China had a higher NAFLD incidence compared to non-China regions (p = 0.012) and Japan a lower incidence compared to non-Japan regions (p = 0.005). Conclusions: NAFLD incidence is increasing with a current estimate of 4,613 new cases per 100,000 person-years. Males and overweight/obese individuals had significantly higher incidence rates compared to females and those of normal weight. Public health interventions for prevention of NAFLD are needed with a special emphasis on males, overweight/obese individuals, and higher risk regions. Impact and implications: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects approximately 30% of people worldwide and appears to be increasing, but data to estimate the incidence rate are limited. In this meta-analytic study of over 1.2 million people, we estimated an incidence rate of NAFLD of 46.13 per 1,000 person-years with significant differences by sex, BMI, geography, and time-period. As treatment options for NAFLD remain limited, prevention of NAFLD should remain the focus of public health strategies. Studies such as these can help policy makers in determining which and whether their interventions are impactful.",

        "cover_date": "2023-03-01",
        "Abstract": "There are scant empirical studies investigating the impact of fiscal policy and environmental policy stringency on consumption-based carbon emissions, especially within the context of the BRICS countries. To fill the voids in prior studies, the current study evaluates the effect of fiscal policy and environmental stringent policy on consumption-based carbon emissions. The study also incorporates other drivers of fiscal consumption-based carbon emissions (CCO2) emissions, such as disintegrated energy and economic growth, using data from 1990 to 2019. Since second-generation econometric methodologies such as augmented mean group (AMG) and common correlated effect means group (CCEMG) were used in the empirical research, this work presents trustworthy and solid empirical evidence. The quantile regression performs better when dealing with unobserved heterogeneity for each cross-section. Quantile regression gives more consistent and trustworthy results than traditional econometric approaches because heterogeneity and non-normality are identified in the dataset. The results from these estimators show that economic growth, nonrenewable energy, and government expenditure intensify CCO2 emissions while taxation revenue, environmental policy stringency and renewable energy mitigate CCO2 emissions. Furthermore, the panel causality test results show that taxation revenue, government expenditure, environmental policy stringency, and renewable energy can predict CCO2 emissions. Policy recommendations are put forward based on these results.",

        "Abstract": "Migraine is one of more than 200 headache disorders but stands out among these as a major cause of population ill health. In migraine epidemiology, the key variable is prevalence, but, from the perspective of public health, prevalence is uninformative without burden estimates. Here, we discuss how migraine epidemiology, from a quite recent start, has evolved into the respectable though imperfect science of today, but with the legacy that much of the large corpus of older literature is of questionable reliability. Newer studies have benefited from a universally accepted definition of migraine, while methodological developments have broadened the scope of migraine caseness, and published guidelines address important methodological issues. In the light of these developments, we question the apparent increase in migraine prevalence over time, offering explanations as to why this may be illusory. We suggest that the current best estimates are that global migraine prevalence is 14–15%, and that migraine accounts for 4.9% of global population ill health quantified in years lived with disability (YLDs). These evaluations are probably under-quantified rather than over-quantified, and YLDs are not a comprehensive measure of migraine-attributed burden. Despite these uncertainties, such high estimates of population ill health have clear implications for health policy.",

        "Abstract": "Background: Plastics have conveyed great benefits to humanity and made possible some of the most significant advances of modern civilization in fields as diverse as medicine, electronics, aerospace, construction, food packaging, and sports. It is now clear, however, that plastics are also responsible for significant harms to human health, the economy, and the earth's environment. These harms occur at every stage of the plastic life cycle, from extraction of the coal, oil, and gas that are its main feedstocks through to ultimate disposal into the environment. The extent of these harms not been systematically assessed, their magnitude not fully quantified, and their economic costs not comprehensively counted. Goals: The goals of this Minderoo-Monaco Commission on Plastics and Human Health are to comprehensively examine plastics' impacts across their life cycle on: (1) human health and well-being; (2) the global environment, especially the ocean; (3) the economy; and (4) vulnerable populations-the poor, minorities, and the world's children. On the basis of this examination, the Commission offers science-based recommendations designed to support development of a Global Plastics Treaty, protect human health, and save lives. Report structure: This Commission report contains seven Sections. Following an Introduction, Section 2 presents a narrative review of the processes involved in plastic production, use, and disposal and notes the hazards to human health and the environment associated with each of these stages. Section 3 describes plastics' impacts on the ocean and notes the potential for plastic in the ocean to enter the marine food web and result in human exposure. Section 4 details plastics' impacts on human health. Section 5 presents a first-order estimate of plastics' health-related economic costs. Section 6 examines the intersection between plastic, social inequity, and environmental injustice. Section 7 presents the Commission's findings and recommendations. Plastics: Plastics are complex, highly heterogeneous, synthetic chemical materials. Over 98% of plastics are produced from fossil carbon- coal, oil and gas. Plastics are comprised of a carbon-based polymer backbone and thousands of additional chemicals that are incorporated into polymers to convey specific properties such as color, flexibility, stability, water repellence, flame retardation, and ultraviolet resistance. Many of these added chemicals are highly toxic. They include carcinogens, neurotoxicants and endocrine disruptors such as phthalates, bisphenols, per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), brominated flame retardants, and organophosphate flame retardants. They are integral components of plastic and are responsible for many of plastics' harms to human health and the environment.Global plastic production has increased almost exponentially since World War II, and in this time more than 8,300 megatons (Mt) of plastic have been manufactured. Annual production volume has grown from under 2 Mt in 1950 to 460 Mt in 2019, a 230-fold increase, and is on track to triple by 2060. More than half of all plastic ever made has been produced since 2002. Single-use plastics account for 35-40% of current plastic production and represent the most rapidly growing segment of plastic manufacture. Explosive recent growth in plastics production reflects a deliberate pivot by the integrated multinational fossil-carbon corporations that produce coal, oil and gas and that also manufacture plastics. These corporations are reducing their production of fossil fuels and increasing plastics manufacture. The two principal factors responsible for this pivot are decreasing global demand for carbon-based fuels due to increases in 'green' energy, and massive expansion of oil and gas production due to fracking. Plastic manufacture is energy-intensive and contributes significantly to climate change. At present, plastic production is responsible for an estimated 3.7% of global greenhouse gas emissions, more than the contribution of Brazil. This fraction is projected to increase to 4.5% by 2060 if current trends continue unchecked. Plastic life cycle: The plastic life cycle has three phases: production, use, and disposal. In production, carbon feedstocks-coal, gas, and oil-are transformed through energy-intensive, catalytic processes into a vast array of products. Plastic use occurs in every aspect of modern life and results in widespread human exposure to the chemicals contained in plastic. Single-use plastics constitute the largest portion of current use, followed by synthetic fibers and construction. Plastic disposal is highly inefficient, with recovery and recycling rates below 10% globally. The result is that an estimated 22 Mt of plastic waste enters the environment each year, much of it single-use plastic and are added to the more than 6 gigatons of plastic waste that have accumulated since 1950. Strategies for disposal of plastic waste include controlled and uncontrolled landfilling, open burning, thermal conversion, and export. Vast quantities of plastic waste are exported each year from high-income to low-income countries, where it accumulates in landfills, pollutes air and water, degrades vital ecosystems, befouls beaches and estuaries, and harms human health-environmental injustice on a global scale. Plastic-laden e-waste is particularly problematic. Environmental findings: Plastics and plastic-associated chemicals are responsible for widespread pollution. They contaminate aquatic (marine and freshwater), terrestrial, and atmospheric environments globally. The ocean is the ultimate destination for much plastic, and plastics are found throughout the ocean, including coastal regions, the sea surface, the deep sea, and polar sea ice. Many plastics appear to resist breakdown in the ocean and could persist in the global environment for decades. Macro- and micro-plastic particles have been identified in hundreds of marine species in all major taxa, including species consumed by humans. Trophic transfer of microplastic particles and the chemicals within them has been demonstrated. Although microplastic particles themselves (>10 µm) appear not to undergo biomagnification, hydrophobic plastic-associated chemicals bioaccumulate in marine animals and biomagnify in marine food webs. The amounts and fates of smaller microplastic and nanoplastic particles (MNPs <10 µm) in aquatic environments are poorly understood, but the potential for harm is worrying given their mobility in biological systems. Adverse environmental impacts of plastic pollution occur at multiple levels from molecular and biochemical to population and ecosystem. MNP contamination of seafood results in direct, though not well quantified, human exposure to plastics and plastic-associated chemicals. Marine plastic pollution endangers the ocean ecosystems upon which all humanity depends for food, oxygen, livelihood, and well-being. Human health findings: Coal miners, oil workers and gas field workers who extract fossil carbon feedstocks for plastic production suffer increased mortality from traumatic injury, coal workers' pneumoconiosis, silicosis, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer. Plastic production workers are at increased risk of leukemia, lymphoma, hepatic angiosarcoma, brain cancer, breast cancer, mesothelioma, neurotoxic injury, and decreased fertility. Workers producing plastic textiles die of bladder cancer, lung cancer, mesothelioma, and interstitial lung disease at increased rates. Plastic recycling workers have increased rates of cardiovascular disease, toxic metal poisoning, neuropathy, and lung cancer. Residents of \"fenceline\" communities adjacent to plastic production and waste disposal sites experience increased risks of premature birth, low birth weight, asthma, childhood leukemia, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer. During use and also in disposal, plastics release toxic chemicals including additives and residual monomers into the environment and into people. National biomonitoring surveys in the USA document population-wide exposures to these chemicals. Plastic additives disrupt endocrine function and increase risk for premature births, neurodevelopmental disorders, male reproductive birth defects, infertility, obesity, cardiovascular disease, renal disease, and cancers. Chemical-laden MNPs formed through the environmental degradation of plastic waste can enter living organisms, including humans. Emerging, albeit still incomplete evidence indicates that MNPs may cause toxicity due to their physical and toxicological effects as well as by acting as vectors that transport toxic chemicals and bacterial pathogens into tissues and cells.Infants in the womb and young children are two populations at particularly high risk of plastic-related health effects. Because of the exquisite sensitivity of early development to hazardous chemicals and children's unique patterns of exposure, plastic-associated exposures are linked to increased risks of prematurity, stillbirth, low birth weight, birth defects of the reproductive organs, neurodevelopmental impairment, impaired lung growth, and childhood cancer. Early-life exposures to plastic-associated chemicals also increase the risk of multiple non-communicable diseases later in life. Economic findings: Plastic's harms to human health result in significant economic costs. We estimate that in 2015 the health-related costs of plastic production exceeded $250 billion (2015 Int$) globally, and that in the USA alone the health costs of disease and disability caused by the plastic-associated chemicals PBDE, BPA and DEHP exceeded $920 billion (2015 Int$). Plastic production results in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions equivalent to 1.96 gigatons of carbon dioxide (CO2e) annually. Using the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) social cost of carbon metric, we estimate the annual costs of these GHG emissions to be $341 billion (2015 Int$).These costs, large as they are, almost certainly underestimate the full economic losses resulting from plastics' negative impacts on human health and the global environment. All of plastics' economic costs-and also its social costs-are externalized by the petrochemical and plastic manufacturing industry and are borne by citizens, taxpayers, and governments in countries around the world without compensation. Social justice findings: The adverse effects of plastics and plastic pollution on human health, the economy and the environment are not evenly distributed. They disproportionately affect poor, disempowered, and marginalized populations such as workers, racial and ethnic minorities, \"fenceline\" communities, Indigenous groups, women, and children, all of whom had little to do with creating the current plastics crisis and lack the political influence or the resources to address it. Plastics' harmful impacts across its life cycle are most keenly felt in the Global South, in small island states, and in disenfranchised areas in the Global North. Social and environmental justice (SEJ) principles require reversal of these inequitable burdens to ensure that no group bears a disproportionate share of plastics' negative impacts and that those who benefit economically from plastic bear their fair share of its currently externalized costs. Conclusions: It is now clear that current patterns of plastic production, use, and disposal are not sustainable and are responsible for significant harms to human health, the environment, and the economy as well as for deep societal injustices.The main driver of these worsening harms is an almost exponential and still accelerating increase in global plastic production. Plastics' harms are further magnified by low rates of recovery and recycling and by the long persistence of plastic waste in the environment.",

        "Abstract": "Green credit policy is a policy enacted by the government to induce enterprises to balance environmental management and green economic development, but how green credit policy affects the green productivity of enterprises in practical situations is a topic worth exploring. This paper uses a double difference model to investigate the impact of green credit policies on green productivity of corporate from 2007 to 2020. It is found that the implementation of the Green Credit Guidelines can significantly improve the green production efficiency of heavy polluting enterprises. The implementation of the Green Credit Guidelines has a greater effect on the green production efficiency of enterprises among enterprises with smaller commercial credit financing scale and enterprises with lower capital use efficiency than other enterprises. The impact of the Green Credit Guidelines on state-owned enterprises, large-scale enterprises, and enterprises in the central and western regions is more obvious. And the implementation of the Green Credit Guidelines can affect the green production efficiency of enterprises through the financing scale effect and financing cost effect. This study provides insights for the government to further standardize the green credit system and ensure the effectiveness of green credit policy implementation, and provides ideas to promote green development of enterprises by analyzing the influencing factors of their green production efficiency.",

        "Abstract": "\"The possibility of being a victim of a crime is ever present on my mind; thinking about it as natural as breathing.\"-40-year-old woman. This is a compelling analysis of how women in the United States perceive the threat of crime in their everyday lives and how that perception controls their behavior. Esther Madriz draws on focus groups and in-depth interviews to show the damage that fear can wreak on women of different ages and socioeconomic backgrounds. Although anxiety about crime affects virtually every woman, Madriz shows that race and class position play a role in a woman's sense of vulnerability. Fear of crime has resulted in public demand for stronger and more repressive policies throughout the country. As funds for social programs are cut, Madriz points out, those for more prisons and police are on the increase. She also illustrates how media images of victims-\"good\" victims aren't culpable, \"bad\" victims invite trouble-and a tough political stance toward criminals are linked to a general climate of economic uncertainty and conservatism. Madriz argues that fear itself is a strong element in keeping women in subservient and self-limiting social positions. \"Policing\" themselves, they construct a restricted world that leads to positions of even greater subordination: Being a woman means being vulnerable. Considering the enormous attention given to crime today, including victims' rights and use of public funds, Madriz's informative study is especially timely.",

        "Abstract": "Quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs), a large class of chemicals that includes high production volume substances, have been used for decades as antimicrobials, preservatives, and antistatic agents and for other functions in cleaning, disinfecting, personal care products, and durable consumer goods. QAC use has accelerated in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the banning of 19 antimicrobials from several personal care products by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2016. Studies conducted before and after the onset of the pandemic indicate increased human exposure to QACs. Environmental releases of these chemicals have also increased. Emerging information on adverse environmental and human health impacts of QACs is motivating a reconsideration of the risks and benefits across the life cycle of their production, use, and disposal. This work presents a critical review of the literature and scientific perspective developed by a multidisciplinary, multi-institutional team of authors from academia, governmental, and nonprofit organizations. The review evaluates currently available information on the ecological and human health profile of QACs and identifies multiple areas of potential concern. Adverse ecological effects include acute and chronic toxicity to susceptible aquatic organisms, with concentrations of some QACs approaching levels of concern. Suspected or known adverse health outcomes include dermal and respiratory effects, developmental and reproductive toxicity, disruption of metabolic function such as lipid homeostasis, and impairment of mitochondrial function. QACs' role in antimicrobial resistance has also been demonstrated. In the US regulatory system, how a QAC is managed depends on how it is used, for example in pesticides or personal care products. This can result in the same QACs receiving different degrees of scrutiny depending on the use and the agency regulating it. Further, the US Environmental Protection Agency's current method of grouping QACs based on structure, first proposed in 1988, is insufficient to address the wide range of QAC chemistries, potential toxicities, and exposure scenarios. Consequently, exposures to common mixtures of QACs and from multiple sources remain largely unassessed. Some restrictions on the use of QACs have been implemented in the US and elsewhere, primarily focused on personal care products. Assessing the risks posed by QACs is hampered by their vast structural diversity and a lack of quantitative data on exposure and toxicity for the majority of these compounds. This review identifies important data gaps and provides research and policy recommendations for preserving the utility of QAC chemistries while also seeking to limit adverse environmental and human health effects.",

        "Abstract": "Over the past years, Malang (Indonesia) has encountered environmental problems due to municipal solid waste (MSW) overgeneration. Nevertheless, the increasing volume and complexity of MSW management in the city could be tackled using digital solutions. As a key location of ICT development, China is a key partner for Indonesia to improve its MSW management using digital technologies. As a miniature of China's sustainable waste management, Nanning represents a model of smart city that applies resource recovery paradigms using digitalization. Using a case-study approach, this work critically investigates how to strengthen waste recycling industry in Malang using digitalization-based circular economy (CE) according to Nanning's experiences in digitalizing waste recycling. It was found that lessons learnt from Nanning in MSW management were transferable and applicable for Malang to replicate its model, while paving the way forward for a transition towards a CE in waste sector. Traditionally, waste segregation at source was not properly conducted in Malang due to lack of environmental awareness and less public participation, while the waste management in Nanning is time-efficient and cost-effective. Nanning's experiences in digitalizing recyclable materials and/or recycled goods could facilitate Malang to shift towards a digitalization-based CE. Integrating automatic segregation and digitalization at waste banks is efficient in terms of time. With digitalization, over 90% of the solid waste in Malang is segregated properly, while diverting 60% of its non-biodegradable trash from landfills. Overall, the use of digital technologies has enabled waste banks to revolutionize waste industry, while promoting sustainable development at local level. To contribute their share to the UN SDGs, other cities in Indonesia are at their transition towards a digitalization-based CE. There is still a long way for them to attain full circularity and reap the benefits of digital transformation in the waste sector. Hence, it is necessary for stakeholders to promulgate effective policies and strengthen CE implementation on non-biodegradable waste through digital technologies.",

        "Abstract": "Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death worldwide and imposes a substantial economic burden. Gaining a thorough understanding of the economic implications of COPD is an important prerequisite for sound, evidence-based policy making. We aimed to estimate the macroeconomic burden of COPD for each country and establish its distribution across world regions. Methods: In this health-augmented macroeconomic modelling study we estimated the macroeconomic burden of COPD for 204 countries and territories over the period 2020–50. The model accounted for (1) the effect of COPD mortality and morbidity on labour supply, (2) age and sex specific differences in education and work experience among those affected by COPD, and (3) the impact of COPD treatment costs on physical capital accumulation. We obtained data from various public sources including the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019, the World Bank database, and the literature. The macroeconomic burden of COPD was assessed by comparing gross domestic product (GDP) between a scenario projecting disease prevalence based on current estimates and a counterfactual scenario with zero COPD prevalence from 2020 to 2050. Findings: Our findings suggest that COPD will cost the world economy INT$4·326 trillion (uncertainty interval 3·327–5·516; at constant 2017 prices) in 2020–50. This economic effect is equivalent to a yearly tax of 0·111% (0·085–0·141) on global GDP. China and the USA face the largest economic burdens from COPD, accounting for INT$1·363 trillion (uncertainty interval 1·034–1·801) and INT$1·037 trillion (0·868–1·175), respectively. Interpretation: The macroeconomic burden of COPD is large and unequally distributed across countries, world regions, and income levels. Our study stresses the urgent need to invest in global efforts to curb the health and economic burdens of COPD. Investments in effective interventions against COPD do not represent a burden but could instead provide substantial economic returns in the foreseeable future.

        "Abstract": "This study explores the impact of digitalization on technological (product and process) innovations in German small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). In particular, three forms of digitalization are considered – digitalization in production and logistics, digital value chains, and big data analytics. Empirical analysis utilizes the Mannheim Innovation Panel (MIP) dataset of German SMEs operating in manufacturing and service sectors. A binary probit model is separately estimated for micro, small and medium-sized firms to test if theoretically assumed positive innovation effects of digitalization occur in SMEs of different size. Empirical findings confirm that the impact of digitalization on innovation activities is heterogenous among SMEs. Furthermore, the innovation effects are modest and depend on the form of digitalization and a type of innovation. The study also explores a moderating effect of internal R&D activities. The findings suggest that the engagement in internal R&D weakness the innovation effects of digitalization. More specifically, the impact of digitalization on product and process innovations is absent in those SMEs that conduct intramural R&D, while in non-R&D SMEs, this impact is positive. Based on these findings, the study offers some theoretical and policy implications.",

SUMMARY ANSWER: International evidence-based guidelines address prioritized questions and outcomes and include 254 recommendations and practice points, to promote consistent, evidence-based care and improve the experience and health outcomes in PCOS. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The 2018 International PCOS Guideline was independently evaluated as high quality and integrated multidisciplinary and consumer perspectives from six continents; it is now used in 196 countries and is widely cited. It was based on best available, but generally very low to low quality, evidence. It applied robust methodological processes and addressed shared priorities. The guideline transitioned from consensus based to evidence-based diagnostic criteria and enhanced accuracy of diagnosis, whilst promoting consistency of care. However, diagnosis is still delayed, the needs of those with PCOS are not being adequately met, evidence quality was low and evidence-practice gaps persist. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: The 2023 International Evidence-based Guideline update reengaged the 2018 network across professional societies and consumer organizations with multidisciplinary experts and women with PCOS directly involved at all stages. Extensive evidence synthesis was completed. Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation-II (AGREEII)-compliant processes were followed. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was applied across evidence quality, feasibility, acceptability, cost, implementation and ultimately recommendation strength and diversity and inclusion were considered throughout. PARTICIPANTS/ MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: This summary should be read in conjunction with the full Guideline for detailed participants and methods. Governance included a six-continent international advisory and management committee, five guideline development groups, and paediatric, consumer, and translation committees. Extensive consumer engagement and guideline experts informed the update scope and priorities. Engaged international society-nominated panels included paediatrics, endocrinology, gynaecology, primary care, reproductive endocrinology, obstetrics, psychiatry, psychology, dietetics, exercise physiology, obesity care, public health and other experts, alongside consumers, project management, evidence synthesis, statisticians and translation experts. Thirty-nine professional and consumer organizations covering 71 countries engaged in the process. Twenty meetings and five face-to-face forums over 12 months addressed 58 prioritized clinical questions involving 52 systematic and 3 narrative reviews. Evidence-based recommendations were developed and approved via consensus across five guideline panels, modified based on international feedback and peer review, independently reviewed for methodological rigour, and approved by the Australian Government National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC). MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The evidence in the assessment and management of PCOS has generally improved in the past five years, but remains of low to moderate quality. The technical evidence report and analyses (∼6000 pages) underpins 77 evidence-based and 54 consensus recommendations, with 123 practice points. Key updates include: i) further refinement of individual diagnostic criteria, a simplified diagnostic algorithm and inclusion of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels as an alternative to ultrasound in adults only; ii) strengthening recognition of broader features of PCOS including metabolic risk factors, cardiovascular disease, sleep apnea, very high prevalence of psychological features, and high risk status for adverse outcomes during pregnancy; iii) emphasizing the poorly recognized, diverse burden of disease and the need for greater healthcare professional education, evidence-based patient information, improved models of care and shared decision making to improve patient experience, alongside greater research; iv) maintained emphasis on healthy lifestyle, emotional wellbeing and quality of life, with awareness and consideration of weight stigma; and v) emphasizing evidence-based medical therapy and cheaper and safer fertility management. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Overall, recommendations are strengthened and evidence is improved, but remain generally low to moderate quality. Significantly greater research is now needed in this neglected, yet common condition. Regional health system variation was considered and acknowledged, with a further process for guideline and translation resource adaptation provided. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The 2023 International Guideline for the Assessment and Management of PCOS provides clinicians and patients with clear advice on best practice, based on the best available evidence, expert multidisciplinary input and consumer preferences. Research recommendations have been generated and a comprehensive multifaceted dissemination and translation programme supports the Guideline with an integrated evaluation program.

Drawing on transaction cost theory and appropriability of knowledge, we adopt a resource-based view to focus on limits to open innovation. We use a generalized multi-level mixed model to test our hypotheses, controlling for time, regional and firm unobserved characteristics. Our sample includes 19,510 observations and 17,859 firms, with a small panel element of 1651 firms mainly from the UK Innovation Survey and Business Registry. Our results demonstrate that limits to open innovation differ across knowledge-intense sectors and at different geographic dimensions, with creative sectors experiencing the greatest limits to knowledge collaboration in both national and international markets. We discuss why and how this occurs, and conclude with several theoretical and policy implications.",

His work, particularly A Theory of Justice, is integral to discussions of social and international justice, democracy, liberalism, welfare economics, and constitutional law, in departments of philosophy, politics, economics, law, public policy, and others. Samuel Freeman is one of Rawls's foremost interpreters. This volume contains nine of his essays on Rawls and Rawlsian justice, two of which are previously unpublished. Freeman places Rawls within historical context in the social contract tradition, addresses criticisms of his positions, and discusses the implications of his views on issues of distributive justice, liberalism and democracy, international justice, and other subjects. This collection will be useful to the wide range of scholars interested in Rawls and theories of justice.",

Williams takes us behind, and beyond, politically expedient labels to provide an incisive and intimate portrait of poor black women in urban America. Drawing on dozens of interviews, Williams challenges the notion that low-income housing was a resounding failure that doomed three consecutive generations of post-war Americans to entrenched poverty. Instead, she recovers a history of grass-roots activism, of political awakening, and of class mobility, all facilitated by the creation of affordable public housing. The stereotyping of black women, especially mothers, has obscured a complicated and nuanced reality too often warped by the political agendas of both the left and the right, and has prevented an accurate understanding of the successes and failures of government anti-poverty policy.",

        "Abstract": "Can renewable energy investments and technologies help achieve carbon neutrality goals? The answer to this question has been neglected until now due to a lack of data. The novelty of this study lies in its exploration of the influence of renewable energy investments and renewable energy technologies on reducing petroleum-derived carbon emissions for the first time in the Group of seven (G7) countries. An additional novel aspect of the study is to discuss how governance indicators, such as regulatory quality, political stability, and democracy, can influence the carbon neutrality targets of the G7 nations. To this end, the study applies second-generation panel data methods, such as the cross-sectionally augmented Dickey-Fuller unit root test, the Durbin-Hausmann panel cointegration test, and the panel augmented mean group estimator. The findings illustrate that renewable energy investments and technologies help reduce carbon emissions in different models. Additionally, while economic growth is beneficial to the environment, governance indicators have no effect on carbon emissions. Overall, the outcomes suggest that G7 countries should increase their investments in renewable energy and support clean technologies to achieve their carbon neutral targets. The study also points out that reducing oil consumption by promoting renewable energy technologies and investments is a critical step toward carbon neutrality for G7 policymakers.",

        "cover_date": "2023-08-01",
        "Abstract": "Low-carbon city pilot policies (LCCPPs) are a crucial initiative to fulfill “peak carbon dioxide emissions” and “carbon neutrality”, which may also have prominent impacts on employment and economic development. We exploit the implementation of China's LCCPPs as an exogenous policy shock and employ a difference-in-differences (DID) model to investigate how LCCPPs affect enterprises' labor demand and their mechanisms. We observe that LCCPPs significantly increase enterprises' labor demand in pilot regions. After employing the instrumental variable approach to mitigate endogeneity problems, the results still hold. The mechanism analysis reveals that the implementation of LCCPPs enhances enterprises' labor demand by guiding or forcing enterprises to engage in front-end environment governance (changes in the production process). Specifically, this policy guides enterprises to develop innovative products and technologies that are beneficial to the environment, which not only directly stimulates the demand for technical personnel, but also boosts firm productivity and profits, thereby triggering the demand for personnel in the non-technical sector. Heterogeneity results show that LCCPPs significantly spur the labor demand of high-carbon emitting enterprises and low financing constraint enterprises. Furthermore, LCCPPs play a prominent role in stimulating the labor demand of enterprises in non-resource-based cities or cities with stringent environmental law enforcement. Our findings provide empirical support for other countries to drive the transformation of their economic system to low-carbon and green growth.",

        "Abstract": "As the first step toward establishing the development of new energy vehicles (NEVs) as a national strategic priority, China's New Energy Vehicle Pilot City (NEVPC) policy has far-reaching significance for helping to develop China's capabilities in NEV industry. The existing literature focuses on the city- and industry-level impacts of this policy but ignores the important role of individual enterprises as innovation agents. In addition, in assessing the policy's effects technological innovation for NEV enterprises is typically measured in terms of output quantity, with no emphasis on innovation efficiency. This study uses balanced panel data from 2006 to 2020 covering 196 listed Chinese NEV enterprises to examine the mechanism and impact of the NEVPC policy on technological innovation within NEV enterprises. We show that the policy has achieved the goal of expanding government subsidies and had a significantly positive impact on the number of technological innovations produced by these enterprises, via a partial mediation effect. However, neither the policy nor the mechanism of government subsidies is effective in improving the efficiency of technological innovations for NEV enterprises. These results have important implications for formulating and improving policies for the NEV industry.",

        "Abstract": "The unrelenting surge in global warming in the current era suggests the inevitable need for governments across the globe to embark on policy measures that will help flatten the curve of the surging emissions. Consequently, the concept of carbon neutrality has become a vital policy approach for countries to achieve sustainable development. The present study extends the debates on carbon neutrality by examining the extent to which prominent factors such as natural resource dependence, eco-innovation, and green energy (biofuel and renewable energy) facilitate or hinder strides toward achieving carbon neutral environment in G7 economies. The study considers the additional roles of carbon tax, environmental policy stringency, and financial development in longitudinal data ranging from 1997 to 2019. The verification of the stated hypotheses hinges on a battery of estimators comprising cross-sectional ARDL, common correlated effects mean group, augmented mean group, and panel quantile regression. The empirical findings show that green energy, carbon tax, and environmental policy support the drive towards carbon neutrality by reducing the stock of CO2 emissions. On the other hand, natural resource dependence and financial development hinder the carbon neutrality agenda by escalating the surge in CO2 emissions. Robustness analyses are conducted from the angle of an additional outcome variable and estimation technique of which the results corroborate the empirical regularity of the main findings. Policy implications are derived from the empirical findings.",

        "Abstract": "Purpose: This study focuses on establishing relations with some important but underestimated elements of knowledge dynamics and firm orientations to characterize organizational circular economy activities through eco-innovation (EIN). The advent of the circular economy (CE) in this post-pandemic era has brought unpredictable sustainable challenges for the manufacturing industries. This research paper aims to bring more clarity to the extant literature on the relationship between environmental innovation (EI) and CE. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, a systematic literature review methodology was used to research the determinants of EI in the knowledge environment that drives the implementation of a CE. Findings: This paper proposes a framework that articulates organizational learning and orientation dynamics and offers a new set of internal knowledge resources for a corporate CE. It is found that change toward CE requires connection with EI. However, successful CE growth largely depends on leveraging knowledge resources and orientation dynamics (stakeholder orientation, sustainability orientation, organization learning orientation and entrepreneurial orientation). CE techniques are still in their early phases of adoption and their implementation is still in its development. Circular knowledge economy (CKE) has the potential to be a useful alternative to achieving thriving CE to achieve sustainability in local and global businesses operations. Practical implications: This study helps companies to understand the organizational learning and different orientation dynamics for achieving CE principles. The research findings imply that EI is critical in establishing a sustainable transition toward CE through organizational learning and orientation dynamics and has garnered significant attention from academics, public policymakers and practitioners. The proposed framework can guide managers to develop sustainable policies related to the CE. This research recognizes that firm-level CKE is important in shaping how knowledge resources relate to CE within transition management literature. Originality/value: This paper abridges the knowledge gap in identifying key drivers and presents the current eminence, challenges and prognostications of sustainable EI parameters in the changing climate of CE. This study builds a framework that combines insights from different viewpoints and disciplines and extends one’s understanding of the relationship between EI and CE. From a theoretical perspective, this study explains the knowledge management complexity links between EI and CE. It builds a theoretical bridge between EI and CE to illustrate how firms transition toward CE following the recommendations. Thus, researchers should continue to support their research with appropriate theories that have the potential to explain EI and CE relationship phenomena, with a particular emphasis on some promising but underutilized theories such as organizational learning, dynamic capabilities and stakeholder theories.",

How are the opposing claims of interest groups evaluated? Why do certain issues capture the public's attention? In Making Environmental Policy, Daniel Fiorino combines the hands-on experience of an insider with the analytic rigor of a scholar to provide the fullest, most readable introduction to federal environmental policymaking yet published. A committed environmental advocate, he takes readers from theory to practice, demonstrating how laws and institutions address environmental needs and balance them against other political pressures. Drawing on the academic literature and his own familiarity with current trends and controversies, Fiorino offers a lucid view of the institutional and analytic aspects of environmental policymaking. A chapter on analytic methods describes policymakers' attempts to apply objective standards to complex environmental decisions. The book also examines how the law, the courts, political tensions, and international environmental agencies have shaped environmental issues. Fiorino grounds his discussion with references to numerous specific cases, including radon, global warming, lead, and hazardous wastes. Timely and necessary, this is an invaluable handbook for students, activists, and anyone wanting to unravel contemporary American environmental politics.",

Currently, increasing public awareness of the problems posed by the current industrialized food system has resulted in increased support for the creative market for economically, socially, and ecologically sustainable food production systems and enhanced demands for variations in agricultural policies and regulations. In food production, the restoration and protection of ecosystems and sustainable food systems must be given priority, which requires a forward-looking rational management strategy and fundamental changes in patterns and practices of economic development, product, and production. Food systems should be redesigned to have a neutral and positive environmental impact, as well as ensure healthy nutrition and food safety, and low environmental impact strategies should become a priority. This review paper aims to discuss, build, guide and evaluate sustainable food systems, principles, and transition strategies such as agroecological, organic, biodynamic, regenerative, urban, and precision agriculture, which are imperative visions for the management of agriculture and food production. To this end, we analyzed the evolution of the established strategies to develop sustainable agriculture and food systems, and we created assessment of key sustainability issues related to food, environment, climate, and rural development priorities and resource use practices.",

        "Abstract": "Even though the literature is becoming more swamped with research on the causes of environmental degradation, the uniqueness of some nations that strongly emphasize resource depletion has been largely ignored. Following the concept of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC), this study considers the resource richness of India while examining the consequences of natural resource rent (NRR), GDP, and the interaction of NRR and GDP on environmental degradation controlling urbanization and energy use. To this end, we harnessed data from 1970 to 2018 and applied dynamic autoregressive distributed lag (DARDL) simulation and frequency domain causality (FDC) approach. The baseline model reveals that economic activities have heterogeneous yet significant impacts on environmental quality, and we validate the existence of an “N-shaped” EKC hypothesis in India in the presence of CO2 emission as the dependent variable. However, we failed to verify the N-shaped EKC with the ecological footprint as our dependent variable. The natural resource rent, energy consumption, and urbanization are also positively linked to long-term environmental degradation. The interaction term of NRR and GDP positively impacts CO2 emissions and ecological footprint. In addition, the value of the turnaround point was higher with the interaction term compared to that without the interaction term, further indicating the negative externalities of the interaction term. According to FDC's results, a feedback loop between economic development and CO2 emissions is highlighted. The robustness check further endorses the findings of our baseline models. The insights have far-reaching policy implications, discussed in the ultimate section.",

        "Abstract": "The impacts of climate change and air pollution on respiratory diseases present significant global health challenges. This review aims to investigate the effects of the interactions between these challenges focusing on respiratory diseases. Climate change is predicted to increase the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events amplifying air pollution levels and exacerbating respiratory diseases. Air pollution levels are projected to rise due to ongoing economic growth and population expansion in many areas worldwide, resulting in a greater burden of respiratory diseases. This is especially true among vulnerable populations like children, older adults, and those with pre-existing respiratory disorders. These challenges induce inflammation, create oxidative stress, and impair the immune system function of the lungs. Consequently, public health measures are required to mitigate the effects of climate change and air pollution on respiratory health. The review proposes that reducing greenhouse gas emissions contribute to slowing down climate change and lessening the severity of extreme weather events. Enhancing air quality through regulatory and technological innovations also helps reduce the morbidity of respiratory diseases. Moreover, policies and interventions aimed at improving healthcare access and social support can assist in decreasing the vulnerability of populations to the adverse health effects of air pollution and climate change. In conclusion, there is an urgent need for continuous research, establishment of policies, and public health efforts to tackle the complex and multi-dimensional challenges of climate change, air pollution, and respiratory health. Practical and comprehensive interventions can protect respiratory health and enhance public health outcomes for all.",

        "Abstract": "Although studied for decades by the research community, artificial intelligence (AI) in education has recently sparked much public debate with the wide-spread popularity of systems such as ChatGPT and DALL-E. Existing literature offers a wealth of research on design, deploying and evaluating AI-driven systems in education. However, the challenges related to the growing influence of AI in the society, calls for revisiting research foundations of AI in education in order to inform decision-making in policy and guide future research. This special issue of Computers & Education: Artificial Intelligence brings 11 papers that explore the theme of empowering learners for the age of AI. The contributions of these papers can be broadly grouped into seven main themes: intersection between AI and humans that looks at the space of coordination; assessment that explores challenges and opportunities afforded by the use of AI in educational assessment; explainability in AI as a critical need for humans in education to understand and trust AI; design for learning that offers principles for designing AI-driven systems and educational opportunities; conceptual AI and learning exploring the need for the development of new theories of learning and their connections with existing theoretical foundations in education; accurate predictions and their role in future education; and applications of AI in classrooms and educational systems. The findings of these studies highlight pressing research and policies challenges and opportunities that arise with the broad penetration of AI in education. They also emphasize the need for future research that addresses issues of ethics, bias and farness in the use of AI in education; challenges associated with data sources and ownership as the key fuel and enabler of present-day AI generation; AI literacies and competencies of stakeholders who use and are impacted by AI in education; identification of effective learning and teaching practices with the use of AI; and policy development to increase responsiveness of education systems to rapid changes driven by AI.",

To achieve the study objective, fuzzy decision-making modeling technique is applied. The results revealed that bank loans are now the main source of financing for energy efficiency projects. Project-based financing might be replaced with Energy Performance Contracts (EPC) warranting energy efficiency investment. Moreover, green banks invest both public and private funds in energy efficiency promoting economic growth. The usage of green bonds for financing environmentally beneficial projects or companies is limitless. Providing for screening energy efficiency investment proposals with small payback hurdle rates might have large opportunity costs. Green bonds can be used to remove the financing barriers for green finance and sustainability tool. On this, study provides policy implications to key stakeholders; if suggested policy suggestions implemented successfully, these would help to enhance scope of green bond financing to uplift energy efficiency financing and green growth successfully.",

        "cover_date": "2023-03-01",
        "Abstract": "The construction sector is one of the most responsible worldly for resource consumption, waste generation, and greenhouse gas emissions. The transition to a circular production and consumption system is crucial to reducing the impacts of the sector. However, the lack of clarity and understanding of the principles of circular economy (CE) and the complexity of the construction value chain makes it difficult to implement circular principles in the sector. Through a systematic literature review, this study analyzes the barriers, drivers, and stakeholders that influence the implementation of CE in the sector. The barriers and drivers were classified into five categories (economic, informational, institutional, political, and technological) and the main stakeholders were identified. From the results, the political and technological barriers categories were the most representative, highlighting the need for a governance policy based on regulatory and tax actions, and an integrated waste and information management system. The study's categorical analysis revealed that the lack of CE awareness and communication is the central interrelated agent to promoting circular principles in the sector. The sector needs joint action between government and construction stakeholders to the establishment of public-private partnerships and effective and segmented communication aimed at the circular transition in the sector.",

In two large-scale national surveys (NTotal = 950) conducted in the United States and the United Kingdom, and secondary analysis of data from 56 countries (N = 50,757), we found a robust, positive relationship between national narcissism and proneness to believe and disseminate conspiracy theories related to COVID-19. Furthermore, belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories was related to less engagement in health behaviors and less support for public-health policies to combat COVID-19. Our findings illustrate the importance of social identity factors in the spread of conspiracy theories and provide insights into the psychological processes underlying the COVID-19 pandemic.",

        "cover_date": "2023-01-01",
        "Abstract": "China has made remarkable progress in the construction of its digital infrastructure in recent years. The role of digital infrastructure in the reduction of emissions has become increasingly prominent. This study attempted to assess the impact of digital infrastructure on carbon emissions and identify its mechanism based on panel data for 215 Chinese cities from 2011 to 2019. The empirical results indicate that digital infrastructure has significantly increased total carbon emissions, per capita carbon emissions, and carbon intensity in Chinese cities, with marginal effects of 1.818, 0.0515, and 0.995, respectively. The conclusions still hold after a series of robustness tests such as introducing instrumental variable estimation and the exogenous policy shock of Broadband China. The mechanism analysis indicates that digital infrastructure could inhibit urban carbon mitigation and energy conservation by inducing per capita energy consumption, total energy inputs, marginal diminishing factor productivity gains, and increasingly energy intensity. The carbon emission trading scheme can effectively mitigate the effect of digital infrastructure in Chinese cities, while the energy-consuming right trading system does not mitigate the environmental externalities of digital infrastructure. This study may help policymakers better understand the effect of digital infrastructure on the environment, and it presents policy implications related to the accelerating construction of digital infrastructure in China.",

        "Abstract": "The integration of urban natural resources and smart city technologies as a means to promote sustainability is investigated in this study using a descriptive-analytical literature review. The study identifies key elements associated with the incorporation of green spaces and smart technologies within smart cities. The findings show that green spaces can promote environmental sustainability in smart cities when utilized as renewable energy sources, natural filters, and public spaces. However, effectively managing green spaces requires the implementation of smart technologies such as sensors to monitor and analyze data on factors such as air pollution, temperature, and irrigation levels. The study evaluates the challenges of green space data analysis such as cost, data reliability, privacy, and expertise, and reveals that Western and Eastern cities take different approaches to green space data analysis, focusing on environmental/social and urban planning benefits respectively. The importance of technologies and policies aimed at addressing environmental issues in disadvantaged communities, including air pollution, is emphasized. Effective strategies such as the deployment of air quality sensors, green infrastructure, and transit-oriented development can improve air quality and health, though success depends on policy design, resources, and infrastructure. Furthermore, the study explores the potential of advanced technologies and strategies to manage sustainable energy resources in smart cities, including smart grids, renewable energy, and energy-efficient buildings. The study also discusses the potential of smart technologies such as precision irrigation, smart metering, and waste management initiatives to reduce water usage and waste. The study concludes that technology and policy innovation can converge to yield environmental wellbeing through efficiency and reduced harm. By embracing sustainability, communities can lead in creating livable smart cities. The findings offer insights for policymakers, planners, and researchers on managing natural resources and promoting sustainable development in smart cities.",

        "Abstract": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, the economic recession has been experienced by the entire world. This recession has caused the prices of natural resources to shrink due to a reduction in energy demand. This has caused the renewable energy projects to lose the interest of public and private finance participation. Moreover, these trends have led to a reduction in the competitiveness of renewable energy project projects that could have led to the achievement of sustainable development goals. The present study has investigated the causality relationship between investments in renewable energy and green finance while considering factors like economic growth electricity output of the renewable energy sector and the investment of private sectors in the energy sector development. China serves as the study's setting, and time series data from 2000 to 2020 were employed throughout the previous 21 years. The researcher has shown that IR, REO, and GF exhibit more erratic behaviour in comparison to GDP and IEP in the chosen period using the new technique of the wavelet power spectrum. Additionally, the coherence wavelet technique has shown that there is a unidirectional causal link from GDP to IR and IR to GF as well as a bidirectional substantial correlation between IR and our REO. In both long and short-run analyses, different kinds of causal relationships have been found. However, IEP did not show any link with IR. Based on the empirical findings in the current study the researcher recommends that the Chinese government should design specific policies to deal with the volatility in IR, GF, REO while also looking to enhance investments in these sectors to achieve sustainable growth, environmental sustainability, and increased investments in renewable energy projects for the production of increased renewable energy in China.",

        "Abstract": "The exponential growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies requires high data security. Here, data security is very critical as all IoT devices transfer data over the Internet. The fine-grained access control provided by the ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) technique can be considered as a potential solution to this issue. However, most of the CP-ABE schemes use bilinear pairing operations for its internal working, which is expensive for any resource constraint device. An elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) based CP-ABE scheme can be well suited for resource constraint IoT framework because ECC takes less computational time. This article proposes a novel CP-ABE technique based on ECC to achieve fine-grained access control over data or resources. The proposed technique includes multiple attribute authorities to manage attributes and key generation, which can reduce the work overhead of having a single authority in traditional CP-ABE systems. In addition, the proposed scheme outsources the decryption process to a user assistant entity to reduce the decryption overhead of the end-users. To prove the efficiency of the proposed scheme, both formal security analysis and performance comparisons are presented in this article. The result and findings prove the effectiveness of the proposed scheme over some well-known schemes.",

Synthetic data has shown promise in finance and economics to improve risk assessment, portfolio optimization, and algorithmic trading. However, higher stakes, potential liabilities, and healthcare practitioner distrust make clinical use of synthetic data difficult. This paper explores the potential benefits and limitations of synthetic data in the healthcare analytics context. We begin with real-world healthcare applications of synthetic data that informs government policy, enhance data privacy, and augment datasets for predictive analytics. We then preview future applications of synthetic data in the emergent field of digital twin technology. We explore the issues of data quality and data bias in synthetic data, which can limit applicability across different applications in the clinical context, and privacy concerns stemming from data misuse and risk of re-identification. Finally, we evaluate the role of regulatory agencies in promoting transparency and accountability and propose strategies for risk mitigation such as Differential Privacy (DP) and a dataset chain of custody to maintain data integrity, traceability, and accountability. Synthetic data can improve healthcare, but measures to protect patient well-being and maintain ethical standards are key to promote responsible use.",

Rapid action to decarbonize economies and build resilience is justified on health, human rights, environmental and economic grounds. While the necessary health response is wide ranging, it can largely be encapsulated within three grand challenges: (i) promote actions that both reduce carbon emissions and improve health; (ii) build better, more climate-resilient and low-carbon health systems; and (iii) implement public health measures to protect from the range of climate risks to health. The health community can make a unique and powerful contribution, applying its trusted voice to climate leadership and advocacy, providing evidence for action, taking responsibility for climate resilience and decarbonization of healthcare systems, and guiding other sectors whose actions impact substantially on health, carbon emissions and climate resilience.",

Design, setting: Cross-sectional national survey; mobile telephone interviews using random digit dialling (computer-generated), Australia, 9 April – 11 October 2021. Retrospective self-report data using validated questionnaire (Juvenile Victimisation Questionnaire-R2 Adapted Version (Australian Child Maltreatment Study). Participants: People aged 16 years or more. The target sample size was 8500 respondents: 3500 people aged 16–24 years and 1000 respondents each from five further age groups (25–34, 35–44, 45–54, 55–64, 65 years or more). Main outcome measures: Proportions of respondents reporting physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, neglect, and exposure to domestic violence to age 18 years, assessed with the Juvenile Victimization Questionnaire-R2 Adapted Version (Australian Child Maltreatment Study), overall and by gender and age group, and weighted to reflect characteristics of the Australian population aged 16 years or more in 2016. Results: Complete survey data were available for 8503 eligible participants (14% response rate). Physical abuse was reported by 32.0% of respondents (95% confidence interval [CI], 30.7–33.3%), sexual abuse by 28.5% (95% CI, 27.3–29.8%), emotional abuse by 30.9% (95% CI, 29.7–32.2%), neglect by 8.9% (95% CI, 8.1–9.7%), and exposure to domestic violence by 39.6% (95% CI, 38.3–40.9%). The proportions of respondents who reported sexual abuse, emotional abuse, or neglect were each statistically significantly larger for women than men. The reported prevalence of physical abuse by respondents aged 16–24 years was lower than for those aged 25–34 years, and that of sexual abuse was lower than for those aged 35–44 years, suggesting recent declines in the prevalence of these maltreatment types. Conclusions: Child maltreatment is common in Australia, and larger proportions of women than men report having experienced sexual abuse, emotional abuse, and neglect during childhood. As physical and sexual abuse may have declined recently, public health policy and practice may have positive effects, justifying continued monitoring and prevention activities.",

Such infections are significant problems for society and healthcare organizations. This study aimed to carry out a systematic review and a meta-analysis to analyze the prevalence of HAIs globally. Methods We conducted a comprehensive search of electronic databases including EMBASE, Scopus, PubMed and Web of Science between 2000 and June 2021. We found 7031 articles. After removing the duplicates, 5430 studies were screened based on the titles/abstracts. Then, we systematically evaluated the full texts of the 1909 remaining studies and selected 400 records with 29,159,630 participants for meta-analysis. Random-effects model was used for the analysis, and heterogeneity analysis and publication bias test were conducted. Results The rate of universal HAIs was 0.14 percent. The rate of HAIs is increasing by 0.06 percent annually. The highest rate of HAIs was in the AFR, while the lowest prevalence were in AMR and WPR. Besides, AFR prevalence in central Africa is higher than in other parts of the world by 0.27 (95% CI, 0.22-0.34). Besides, E. coli infected patients more than other micro-organisms such as Coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In hospital wards, Transplant, and Neonatal wards and ICU had the highest rates. The prevalence of HAIs was higher in men than in women. Conclusion We identified several essential details about the rate of HAIs in various parts of the world. The HAIs rate and the most common micro-organism were different in various contexts. However, several essential gaps were also identified. The study findings can help hospital managers and health policy makers identify the reason for HAIs and apply effective control programs to implement different plans to reduce the HAIs rate and the financial costs of such infections and save resources.",

        "Abstract": "Environmental and social challenges are intensifying globally. Then along comes more demands to deliver successful environmental, social, and governance (ESG) outcomes. Understanding public perceptions of ESG is paramount to gaining public support, advancing ESG actions, and creating a sustainable ESG policy system. This study aims to explore the general public's perceptions of ESG. The setting is China, where ESG is in its infancy and ESG policies are incomplete. Given the richness of social media data, a social media analytics (SMA) framework is applied to obtain public perceptions from Sina Weibo, the largest Chinese social media platform. The SMA framework integrates descriptive analysis, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis to investigate the characteristics of users concerned about ESG, discover latent ESG-based topics from posts and examine corresponding attention, as well as identify public sentiment orientation and opinions on ESG from their comments. The results indicate that there are regional and industry-specific disparities in ESG-conscious users. The latent topics often discussed in posts include ESG investment, ESG disclosure, ESG rating, and ESG notion and practice. It is observed that the increasing number of Weibo posts has not received the corresponding growing attention. The comments containing positive, neutral, and negative sentiments account for 66.03%, 17.37%, and 16.60%, respectively. The negative sentiments might result from the greenwashing effect, inadequate knowledge of ESG, inconsistency among ESG ratings, and lack of transparency in rating methods. The findings can aid policymakers and corporations in proactively comprehending public needs and providing guidance for effective ESG communication on social media and policy improvement.",

        "Abstract": "At the 2015 World Health Assembly, UN member states adopted a resolution that committed to the development of national action plans (NAPs) for antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The political determination to commit to NAPs and the availability of robust governance structures to assure sustainable translation of the identified NAP objectives from policy to practice remain major barriers to progress. Inter-country variability in economic and political resilience and resource constraints could be fundamental barriers to progressing AMR NAPs. Although there have been regional and global analyses of NAPs from a One Health and policy perspective, a global assessment of the NAP objectives targeting antimicrobial use in human populations is needed. In this Health Policy, we report a systematic evidence synthesis of existing NAPs that are aimed at tackling AMR in human populations. We find marked gaps and variability in maturity of NAP development and operationalisation across the domains of: (1) policy and strategic planning; (2) medicines management and prescribing systems; (3) technology for optimised antimicrobial prescribing; (4) context, culture, and behaviours; (5) operational delivery and monitoring; and (6) patient and public engagement and involvement. The gaps identified in these domains highlight opportunities to facilitate sustainable delivery and operationalisation of NAPs. The findings from this analysis can be used at country, regional, and global levels to identify AMR-related priorities that are relevant to infrastructure needs and contexts.",

        "Abstract": "This paper examines the asymmetric effects of the United States Economic Policy Uncertainty (USEPU), Geopolitical Threats (GPRT), Geopolitical Acts (GPRA), and the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil on Green Bond returns. Our study analyses USEPU, GPRT, GPRA, WTI, and Green Bond monthly data from September 2012 to August 2022. By applying the Nonlinear Autoregressive Distributed Lags (NARDL) model, our empirical evidence shows that in the short run, the return on green bonds is negatively affected by an increase in USEPU and GPRA positively affected by an increase in GPRT and WTI. In the long run, the return on green bonds is negatively affected by an increase in USEPU, GPRA, and GPRT but positively affected by WTI. Considering the climate crisis, looking at these findings in the context of green bonds is essential to entice green investments. Policymakers should use our results for a policy design to mitigate green bond market volatility caused by external uncertainties and risks. Furthermore, we conclude that uncertainties should be considered when investing in green bonds and managing investment portfolios.",

        "Abstract": "In the contemporary era, tackling climate change-related problems has become a vital environmental policy agenda, especially for realizing the targets related to SDG-13. Therefore, this study aims to check the efficacy of scaling public investments in research and development for renewable energy development in countering the causes and effects of climate change in leading renewable energy-investing countries. Overall, the findings verify the climate change-inhibiting impact of such investments. By contrast, consumption of natural resources and urbanization are identified as factors responsible for piling up climate change-related concerns in the long run while no impact of net exports, in this regard, is evidenced. Moreover, the long-run results affirm that public investment in renewable energy development projects also exerts moderating effects for partially neutralizing the adverse climate change concerns associated with natural resource consumption and urbanization. Furthermore, such investments are also evidenced to mediate the repercussions of net exports on the causes and effects of climate change in the long run. Based on these key findings, it is recommended to scale budgetary allocations for financing renewable energy technology development-oriented initiatives, enhancing the efficiency rate of natural resource utilization, and deploying environmentally sustainable urbanization policies for achieving the targets concerning objectives of SDG-13.",

This paper uses listed company data and city panel data to investigate the utility and mechanisms of the influence of the development of green finance in different cities on the Green Total Factor Productivity (GTFP) of enterprises. The conclusion was that green finance can improve enterprise GTFP, which remained significant after conducting a series of robustness tests. The mechanism analysis showed that green finance can improve enterprise GTFP by promoting energy conservation and emission reduction. The heterogeneity analysis indicated that green finance has a better effect on non-state-owned enterprises, large-scale enterprises, and enterprises with weak financing constraints. This paper enriches the literature that addresses the impact of green finance and the influential factors among GTFP.",

        "cover_date": "2023-06-01",
        "Abstract": "The generation of microplastics (MPs) has increased recently and become an emerging issue globally. Due to their long-term durability and capability of traveling between different habitats in air, water, and soil, MPs presence in freshwater ecosystem threatens the environment with respect to its quality, biotic life, and sustainability. Although many previous works have been undertaken on the MPs pollution in the marine system recently, none of the study has covered the scope of MPs pollution in the freshwater. To consolidate scattered knowledge in the literature body into one place, this work identifies the sources, fate, occurrence, transport pathways, and distribution of MPs pollution in the aquatic system with respect to their impacts on biotic life, degradation, and detection techniques. This article also discusses the environmental implications of MPs pollution in the freshwater ecosystems. Certain techniques for identifying MPs and their limitations in applications are presented. Through a literature survey of over 276 published articles (2000–2023), this study presents an overview of solutions to the MP pollution, while identifying research gaps in the body of knowledge for further work. It is conclusive from this review that the MPs exist in the freshwater due to an improper littering of plastic waste and its degradation into smaller particles. Approximately 15–51 trillion MP particles have accumulated in the oceans with their weight ranging between 93,000 and 236,000 metric ton (Mt), while about 19–23 Mt of plastic waste was released into rivers in 2016, which was projected to increase up to 53 Mt by 2030. A subsequent degradation of MPs in the aquatic environment results in the generation of NPs with size ranging from 1 to 1000 nm. It is expected that this work facilitates stakeholders to understand the multi-aspects of MPs pollution in the freshwater and recommends policy actions to implement sustainable solutions to this environmental problem.",

        "Abstract": "Cadmium (Cd) is a toxic and carcinogenic pollutant widely distributed in the environment. Dietary intake is the main source of Cd exposure for the nonsmoking population. Assessment of dietary Cd intake provides a pathway to predict Cd body burden and potential health effects. Kidney has been considered as the most sensitive target of chronic Cd exposure. Because of the proportional relationship between Cd accumulation in kidney and Cd excretion via urine, urinary Cd (UCd) has been used as a biomarker of Cd exposure. Here, we review the dietary Cd intake levels in different countries, summarize the global food Cd concentrations reported in both market basket and field surveys, discuss UCd levels among different populations, and illustrate the associations between dietary Cd intake and UCd levels in population-based studies. Recommendations for the prevention and reduction of Cd exposure through anthropogenic inputs and the food chain are also proposed. This review presents a worldwide overview of Cd exposure status through diet for the general population as well as those living in contaminated areas, and provides evidence for policy makers to protect humans from Cd exposure and related health effects.",

These facts for the basis for zero-energy building (ZEB) being established. This novel technology has faced several obstacles impeding its commercialization and future advancement. This investigation therefore holistically explored and evaluated the state of zero energy building and factors impeding their commercialization. The review further proposed some suggestion in terms of technology that can be considered by the sector to augment existing technologies. Similarly, the investigation touched on the effect of occupant's character in zero energy structures. Policies in terms of government subsidies and tax rebates were recommended to encourage more investors into the sector. Finally, the perception of zero energy building being more expensive compared to the traditional structures can equally be curbed via efficient and effective public sensitization.",

        "Abstract": "Purpose of Review: This review aims to examine (i) the aetiology of obesity; (ii) how and why a perception of personal responsibility for obesity so dominantly frames this condition and how this mindset leads to stigma; (iii) the consequences of obesity stigma for people living with obesity, and for the public support for interventions to prevent and manage this condition; and (iv) potential strategies to diminish our focus on personal responsibility for the development of obesity, to enable a reduction of obesity stigma, and to move towards effective interventions to prevent and manage obesity within the population. Recent Findings: We summarise literature which shows that obesity stems from a complex interplay of genetic and environment factors most of which are outside an individual’s control. Despite this, evidence of obesity stigmatisation remains abundant throughout areas of media, entertainment, social media and the internet, advertising, news outlets, and the political and public health landscape. This has damaging consequences including psychological, physical, and socioeconomic harm. Summary: Obesity stigma does not prevent obesity. A combined, concerted, and sustained effort from multiple stakeholders and key decision-makers within society is required to dispel myths around personal responsibility for body weight, and to foster more empathy for people living in larger bodies. This also sets the scene for more effective policies and interventions, targeting the social and environmental drivers of health, to ultimately improve population health.",

        "Abstract": "Background Exposure to visual posts featuring e-cigarette products on social media is associated with increased e-cigarette use among US adolescents. Instagram is the largest source of e-cigarette social media marketing, where influencers—for example, bloggers, brand ambassadors—post promotional materials. This study analysed the network of e-cigarette brands and influencers on Instagram, characterising the most central players in e-cigarette social media marketing. Methods We tracked influencers with public profiles on Instagram who posted promotional e-cigarette content in 2020, had over 1000 followers and high user engagement rate (ratio of likes and comments to followers) of 1%–25% per post. By conducting a social network analysis, we identified the most central (highly involved in promotional activities) influencers and e-cigarette brands. The number of the influencers’ followers aged 13–17 years old and the age verification practices restricting youth access were also assessed. Results There is a highly interconnected network of engaging e-cigarette influencers (n=55) worldwide who collaborated with over 600 e-cigarette brands in 2020. The Asian and US influencers had five to six times more teenage followers compared with the European influencers. 75% of the influencers did not restrict youth access to their promotional content on Instagram. The brands Voopotech, Innokin, Geekvape, Lost Vape, Smok and Vaporesso collaborated with the largest number of influencers (mean n=20). Conclusions It is important to understand associations among influencers and e-cigarette use behaviours, especially youth, to inform effective public health communication and potential policies that could regulate social media marketing sponsored by e-cigarette companies.",

        "Abstract": "Indicators are a fundamental tool for destinations in their progress towards a more sustainable tourism development. However, the lack of real progress and the accelerated technological change are obliging policy makers to rethink the existing indicator systems. This paper examines the relationship between smart cities and destinations and sustainable tourism indicators by analyzing proposals at different scales. It provides a critical review of international smart city standards and the role that sustainability indicators play within them. Then, it conducts a content analysis of planning instruments applied in smart strategies in Spain, focusing on how sustainability indicators are considered under the smart paradigm. At the regional-local scale, this research compares two sets of indicators and tests the scientific validity of one of them for addressing the imbalance suffered by many indicators between their usefulness for policy makers and their academic rigor. The results show that little progress has been achieved despite the appropriation of the sustainability discourse by smart city and smart destination promoters. These findings reveal the (limited) real contribution made by smart cities/destinations to sustainable tourism development and contribute to identifying weaknesses and opportunities so as to redirect smart policies and projects. A final discussion contextualizes the findings within the novel framework of smart sustainability and highlights the need to reinforce public governance of urban and tourist spaces.",

        "Abstract": "Alcohol: No Ordinary Commodity is a collaborative effort by an international group of addiction scientists to improve the linkages between addiction science and alcohol policy. It presents, in a comprehensive, practical, and readily accessible form, the accumulated scientific knowledge on alcohol research that has a direct relevance to the development of alcohol policy on local, national, and international levels. It provides an objective basis on which to build relevant policies globally and informs policy makers who have direct responsibility for public health and social welfare. By locating alcohol policy primarily within the realm of public health, this book draws attention to the growing tendency for governments, both national and local, to consider alcohol misuse as a major determinant of ill health, and to organize societal responses accordingly. The scope of the book is comprehensive and global. The authors describe the conceptual basis for a rational alcohol policy and present new epidemiological data on the global dimensions of alcohol misuse. The core of the book is a critical review of the cumulative scientific evidence in seven general areas of alcohol policy: pricing and taxation, regulating the physical availability of alcohol, modifying the environment in which drinking occurs, drinking-driving countermeasures, marketing restrictions, primary prevention programs in schools and other settings, and treatment and early intervention services. The final chapters discuss the current state of alcohol policy in different parts of the world and describe the need for a new approach to alcohol policy that is evidence-based, global, and coordinated. A valuable resource for those involved in addiction science and drug policy, as well as those in the wider fields of public health, health policy, epidemiology, and practising clinicians.",

        "Abstract": "Steady improvements in ambient air quality in the USA over the past several decades, in part a result of public policy1,2, have led to public health benefits1–4. However, recent trends in ambient concentrations of particulate matter with diameters less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5), a pollutant regulated under the Clean Air Act1, have stagnated or begun to reverse throughout much of the USA5. Here we use a combination of ground- and satellite-based air pollution data from 2000 to 2022 to quantify the contribution of wildfire smoke to these PM2.5 trends. We find that since at least 2016, wildfire smoke has influenced trends in average annual PM2.5 concentrations in nearly three-quarters of states in the contiguous USA, eroding about 25% of previous multi-decadal progress in reducing PM2.5 concentrations on average in those states, equivalent to 4 years of air quality progress, and more than 50% in many western states. Smoke influence on trends in the number of days with extreme PM2.5 concentrations is detectable by 2011, but the influence can be detected primarily in western and mid-western states. Wildfire-driven increases in ambient PM2.5 concentrations are unregulated under current air pollution law6 and, in the absence of further interventions, we show that the contribution of wildfire to regional and national air quality trends is likely to grow as the climate continues to warm.",

        "Abstract": "Wildfire is a common phenomenon in Mediterranean countries but the 2022 fire season has been extreme in southwest Europe (Portugal, Spain and France). Here we provide a preliminary but comprehensive analysis of 2022's wildfire season in southwest Europe. Burned area has exceeded the 2001–2021 median by a factor of 52 in some regions and large wildfires (>500 ha) started to occur in June–July, earlier than the traditional fire season. These anomalies were associated with record-breaking values of fuel dryness, atmospheric water demand and pyrometeorological conditions. Live fuel moisture content was below the historical minima for almost 50 % of the season in some regions. A few large wildfires were responsible for 82 % of the burned area and, in turn, 47 % of the area burned occurred in protected areas. Shrublands, transitional woodlands and conifer forests (but not eucalypt plantations) were the land cover types most affected by extreme fires. As climate change intensifies, we can expect such fire seasons to become the new normal in large parts of the continent, potentially leading to major negative impacts on rural economies. These results highlight the need for landscape level fuel management also in protected areas, to avoid fire-induced biodiversity losses and landscape scale degradation.

        "Abstract": "Introduction: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive disease of growing prevalence, posing serious concerns for global public health. While the economic burden of CKD is substantial, data on the cost of CKD is limited, despite growing pressures on healthcare systems. In this review, we summarise the available evidence in 31 countries and regions and compile a library of costing methodology and estimates of CKD management and disease-associated complications across 31 countries/regions within the Inside CKD programme. Methods: We collected country/region-specific CKD costs via a pragmatic rapid literature review of local literature and engagement with local experts. We extracted cost data and definitions from identified sources for CKD stages G3a–5, kidney failure with replacement therapy by modality, covering haemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and kidney transplants, and disease-associated complications in local currency, converted to United States dollars (USD) and inflated to 2022. Results: Annual direct costs associated with CKD management rose by an average factor of 4 in each country/region upon progression from stage G3a to G5. Mean annual costs per patient increased considerably more from early stages versus dialysis (stage G3a, mean: $3060 versus haemodialysis, mean: $57,334; peritoneal dialysis, mean: $49,490); with estimates for annual costs of transplant also substantially higher (incident: $75,326; subsequent: $16,672). The mean annual per patient costs of complications were $18,294 for myocardial infarction, $8463 for heart failure, $10,168 for stroke and $5975 for acute kidney injury. Costing definitions varied widely in granularity and/or definition across all countries/regions. Conclusion: Globally, CKD carries a significant economic burden, which increases substantially with increasing disease severity. We identified significant gaps in published costs and inconsistent costing definitions. Cost-effective interventions that target primary prevention and disease progression are essential to reduce CKD burden. Our results can be used to guide cost collection and facilitate better comparisons across countries/regions to inform healthcare policy.",

        "Abstract": "The intensification of countries’ growth causes the depletion of natural resources, biodiversity degradation, ecological imbalances, damage, and disasters. The aggravation of ecological issues requires the development of mechanisms for simultaneous achievement of economic, social, and ecological goals. The energy sector is the core direction of economic decarbonization. Therefore, green economic growth requires economic development due to the extension of innovative technologies for renewable energies and relevant investment for that. The study aims to test the hypothesis on the impact of green field investment on green economic growth. The object of the research was countries in the European Union (EU) for 2006–2020. This study applied the Malmquist-Luenberger Global Productivity Index to estimate green economic growth. It considers the resources available for the production process in the country (labor, capital, energy), the desired outcome (gross domestic product) and undesirable results (emissions to the environment) of this process. The study applied the Tobit model to test the hypothesis. The findings confirm the spatial heterogeneity of green economic growth among the EU countries. The asymmetry in technological efficiency and progress limits the efficacy of green innovations. At the same time, the obtained data confirm the research hypothesis. It is shown that along with green investments, economic openness and the efficiency of public governance have a positive effect on the green economic growth of countries. The findings highlight the importance of attracting green investments to increase green innovations in renewable energy, which boost green economic growth. This study explored the linear and direct effects of green investment on the green economic growth while eliminating the transmission impact of other mediating factors. It should be noted that further research should analyze the nonlinear impact of green investment on the green economic growth and the mediating effect, which could be caused by other variables (corruption, governance efficiency, green innovations, etc.).",

        "Abstract": "Objectives To evaluate the most up-to-date burden of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and spinal cord injury (SCI) and analyse their leading causes in different countries/territories. Design An analysis of Global Burden of Disease (GBD) data. Setting The epidemiological data were gathered from GBD Results Tool (1 January, 1990 \"€31 December 2019) covering 21 GBD regions and 204 countries/ territories. Participants Patients with TBI/SCI. Main outcomes and measures Absolute numbers and age-standardised rates/estimates of incidence, prevalence and years lived with disability (YLDs) of TBI/SCI by location in 2019, with their percentage changes from 1990 to 2019. The leading causes (eg, falls) of TBI/SCI in 204 countries/territories. Results Globally, in 2019, TBI had 27.16 million new cases, 48.99 million prevalent cases and 7.08 million YLDs. SCI had 0.91 million new cases, 20.64 million prevalent cases and 6.20 million YLDs. Global age-standardised incidence rates of TBI decreased significantly by -5.5% (95% uncertainty interval -8.9% to -3.0%) from 1990 to 2019, whereas SCI had no significant change (-6.1% (-17.3% to 1.5%)). Regionally, in 2019, Eastern Europe and High-income North America had the highest burden of TBI and SCI, respectively. Nationally, in 2019, Slovenia and Afghanistan had the highest age-standardised incidence rates of TBI and SCI, respectively. For TBI, falls were the leading cause in 74% (150/204) of countries/territories, followed by pedestrian road injuries (14%, 29/204), motor vehicle road injuries (5%, 11/204), and conflict and terrorism (2%, 4/204). For SCI, falls were the leading cause in 97% (198/204) of countries/territories, followed by conflict and terrorism (3%, 6/204). Conclusions Global age-standardised incidence rates of TBI have decreased significantly since 1990, whereas SCI had no significant change. The leading causes of TBI/SCI globally were falls, but variations did exist between countries/territories. Policy-makers should continue to prioritise interventions to reduce falls, but priorities may vary between countries/territories.",

This research has studied the green financing tool as a reliable and effective solution to achieve green economic growth and increase resource efficiency. Using the method of Panel Vector Autoregressive (PVAR), the relationships between green bonds, resource efficiency index, and green economic growth rates in the industrial and agricultural sectors in 29 countries with green financing markets during 2015–2021 were analyzed. The major results confirmed that issuing green bonds and green economic growth in the industry could accelerate agriculture's green economic growth rate. At the same time, resource efficiency has not significantly impacted the green economic growth rate in the agriculture sector. In addition, the feedback hypothesis exists in the relationship between issued green bonds and green economic growth in industry and agriculture. The main recommended policy implications are strengthening and reforming the financial sector, redefining resource efficiency indicators in countries, and developing of digital green financing market.",

        "Abstract": "Sustainable development goals (SDGs) in developing markets to be achieved via the optimization of environmental and financial policy frameworks, it is necessary to comprehend how environmental restrictions affect the nexus between economic stability and biased technical innovation. Thus, the research delves into how green financial development, technological innovation, and environmental regulation play a role in China's pursuit of sustainable development. The assertions were validated using the Generalized Method of Moments estimate using 30 province panel data in mainland China from 1995 to 2020. As shown by the data significant contribution to climate change per person in China's provinces has grown by an average of 15.54%. Green financial development and green technological innovation impact China's sustainable development goals. The results of endogeneity and other robustness tests support the existence of a causal relationship. Green financial innovation and green technical innovation are essential approaches for achieving environmental sustainability. Empirical findings inform the formulation of policy implications leading to the maintenance of green financing, green technological innovation, and environmental regulation as drivers of sustainable growth in the Chinese economy.",

        "Abstract": "The energy consumption of data centers accounts for approximately 1% of that of the world, the average power usage effectiveness is in the range of 1.4–1.6, and the associated carbon emissions account for approximately 2–4% of the global carbon emissions. To reduce the energy consumption of data centers and promote smart, sustainable, and low-carbon city development, this study analyzes the energy conservation and emission-reduction technologies and potential decarbonization paths for data centers, compares the energy-saving situation of 20 typical data center cases, and highlights the impact of green data centers on the global carbon neutrality goal. The analysis reveals that data center energy consumption can be reduced by about 20–40% and 15–27% through IT equipment optimization and cooling technology improvements, respectively. Data center energy-saving strategies must consider differences in geographical location, natural resources, and economic bases. Therefore, this study examines the necessary steps for building zero-carbon data centers from the perspectives of public policy, technological innovation, and resource management. Specifically, the following aspects are explored: 1) accelerating the intelligent and unified management of data center resources; 2) building storage-computing integrated data centers that are compatible with heterogeneous resources and streamlined business models; 3) realizing large-scale and diversified use of clean energy in data centers.",

Sleep should be promoted as an essential pillar of health, equivalent to nutrition and physical activity. To improve sleep health across the globe, a focus on education and awareness, research, and targeted public health policies are needed. We recommend developing sleep health educational programmes and awareness campaigns; increasing, standardising, and centralising data on sleep quantity and quality in every country across the globe; and developing and implementing sleep health policies across sectors of society. Efforts are needed to ensure equity and inclusivity for all people, particularly those who are most socially and economically vulnerable, and historically excluded.",

        "Abstract": "The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) is the largest public health surveillance system in the United States, monitoring a broad range of health-related behaviors among high school students. The system includes a nationally representative Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) and separate school-based YRBSs conducted by states, tribes, territories, and local school districts. In 2021, these surveys were conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic underscored the importance of data in understanding changes in youth risk behaviors and addressing the multifaceted public health needs of youths. This overview report describes 2021 YRBSS survey methodology, including sampling, data collection procedures, response rates, data processing, weighting, and analyses. The 2021 YRBS participation map, survey response rates, and a detailed examination of student demographic characteristics are included in this report. During 2021, in addition to the national YRBS, a total of 78 surveys were administered to high school students across the United States, representing the national population, 45 states, two tribal governments, three territories, and 28 local school districts. YRBSS data from 2021 provided the first opportunity since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic to compare youth health behaviors using long-term public health surveillance. Approximately half of all student respondents represented racial and ethnic minority groups, and approximately one in four identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual, questioning, or other (a sexual identity other than heterosexual) (LGBQ+). These findings reflect shifts in youth demographics, with increased percentages of racial and ethnic minority and LGBQ+ youths compared with previous YRBSS cycles. Educators, parents, local decision makers, and other partners use YRBSS data to monitor health behavior trends, guide school health programs, and develop local and state policy. These and future data can be used in developing health equity strategies to address long-term disparities so that all youths can thrive in safe and supportive environments. This overview and methods report is one of 11 featured in this MMWR supplement. Each report is based on data collected using methods presented in this overview. A full description of YRBSS results and downloadable data are available (https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/index.htm).",

Then, the paper examines the impact of the GREENQ on CO2 emissions in the panel dataset of 36 OECD countries from 1970 to 2021. The explanatory variables include per capita income, institutional quality and technology. Long-run panel data estimations indicate that per capita income, institutional quality and technology increase CO2 emissions. The novel evidence is that the GREENQ is negatively related to the level of CO2 emissions. These findings are robust to employ different panel data estimation techniques. Potential policy implications are also discussed.",
