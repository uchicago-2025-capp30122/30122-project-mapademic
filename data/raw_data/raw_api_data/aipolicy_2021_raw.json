        "dc:description": "In the pursuit of carbon neutrality, huge changes on the power supply side and the load side have brought forward new requirements and challenges for grid operation and dispatchers. A low-cost and effective measure is real-time power grid network topology optimization and control (NTOC). However, except for the simplest action of line switching, the combinatorial and non-linear nature of the NTOC problem has made existing approaches infeasible for grids of reasonable scales. This paper proposes a novel artificial intelligence (AI) based approach for maximizing available transfer capabilities (ATCs) via network topology control considering various practical constraints and uncertainties. First, imitation learning is utilized to provide a good initial policy for the AI agent. Then, the agent is trained through deep reinforcement learning with a novel guided exploration technique, which significantly improves the training efficiency. Finally, an early warning mechanism is designed to help the agent identify a proper action time, which effectively improves the fault tolerance and robustness of the method. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is tested by using open-sourced data of the IEEE 14-note system.",

        "dc:description": "This study investigates the relationship between digital financial inclusion, external financing, and the innovation performance of high-tech enterprises in China. The choice of corporate financing methods is an important part of organizational behavioral psychology, and different financing models will have a certain effect on organizational performance, especially in the digital economy environment. Therefore, based on resource dependence theory and financing constraint theory, the present study utilizes the panel data collected from the China Stock Market & Accounting Research (CSMAR) database from 2011 to 2020 of 112 companies in the Yangtze River Delta region and the “The Peking University Digital Financial Inclusion Index of China (PKU-DFIIC)” released by the Peking University Digital Finance Research Center and Ant Financial Group. The results show that the Digital Financial Inclusion Index (DFIIC) has a significant positive correlation with the innovation performance of high-tech enterprises. The higher the level of debt financing, the stronger the role of digital financial inclusion in promoting innovation performance. Investigating the DFIIC in terms of coverage breadth and usage depth, we find that usage depth does not significantly encourage innovation performance. The effect of the interaction between coverage breadth and external financing is consistent with the results for the DFIIC. The study suggests that equity financing promotes the usage depth of the DFIIC in state-owned enterprises. In contrast, debt financing promotes the coverage breadth of non-state-owned enterprises. Finally, we propose relevant policy recommendations based on the research results. It includes in-depth popularization of inclusive finance in the daily operations of enterprises at the technical level, refinement of external financing policy incentives for enterprises based on the characteristics of ownership, and strengthening the research of technologies such as big data, artificial intelligence (AI), and cloud computing. The paper presents a range of theoretical and practical implications for practitioners and academics relevant to high-tech enterprises.",

        "dc:description": "What debates have caused spectrum policy to change course and which will determine its future direction? This book examines these issues through a series of chapters from a range of notable experts. The backdrop is a period of turbulent change in what was once a quiet backwater. The past quarter century has seen wireless connectivity go from nice-to-have luxury to the cornerstone of success as nations battle for leadership of the digital economy. The change has been reflected in the crucial role now played by market's mechanisms in a field once dominated by administrative decisions. Spectrum policy's goals have moved far beyond the efficient use of the airwaves to include encouraging economic development, investment, innovation, sustainability and digital inclusivity. Are historic procedures still appropriate in the face of this multiplicity of demands? Are market mechanisms like auctions still the best way to deliver what has become essential infrastructure? Does the process of international coordination need to change? Is spectrum policy's effectiveness limited by the power of global economic forces? Can it reduce rather than add to global warming? Where does 6G and AI fit in? Is public perception the new spectrum policy battle ground? These are all issues examined in The Debates Shaping Spectrum Policy.",

The NVM is a purely neural recurrent architecture that emulates a Turing-complete, purely symbolic virtual machine. We program the NVM with a symbolic algorithm that solves blocks-world restacking problems, and execute it in a robotic simulation environment. Our results show that the NVM-based controller can faithfully replicate the execution traces and performance levels of a traditional non-neural program executing the same restacking procedure. Moreover, after programming the NVM, the neurocomputational encodings of symbolic block stacking knowledge can be fine-tuned to further improve performance, by applying reinforcement learning to the underlying neural architecture.",

        "dc:description": "Administrative transparency, or the condition of an administration made visible and understandable in its processes, is a tool for preventing corruption under two profiles, connected to each other. Firstly, because transparency is a natural antidote to the condition of obscurity, a concealment in which corrupt transactions occur: in fact, corrupt exchange is hidden, because it is concerned in keeping the deviated/illegal interest that it aims to satisfy hidden, as well as the associated distraction/waste of funds. Secondly, because-as a consequence to the above-the public observation ensured by transparency, acts as a deterrent to the execution of such behavior. The chapter intends to explore the different opportunities offered by the \"digitalization\" processes involving public administrations, for the experimentation and application of corruption prevention tools based on the cognitive capacity thus enabled (big data analytics, open data approach, AI, etc.). The analysis will therefore be enriched by a parallel examination of the critical factors that contribute to the effectiveness of each of the mechanisms taken into consideration, such as, for example, legislative hurdles/ inconsistencies; the organizational structures; the role of stakeholders. From this point of view, the chapter intends to underline that the transparency currently applied does not appear to be directly and linearly connected with the digitalization processes, but is rather the result of coherent policies, which are aware of contextual dimensions.",

        "dc:description": "Individuals from a diverse range of backgrounds are increasingly engaging in research and development in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). The main activities, although still nascent, are coalescing around three core activities: innovation, policy, and capacity building. Within agriculture, which is the focus of this paper, AI is working with converging technologies, particularly data optimization, to add value along the entire agricultural value chain, including procurement, farm automation, and market access. Our key takeaway is that, despite the promising opportunities for development, there are actual and potential challenges that African countries need to consider in deciding whether to scale up or down the application of AI in agriculture. Input from African innovators, policymakers, and academics is essential to ensure that AI solutions are aligned with African needs and priorities. This paper proposes questions that can be used to form a road map to inform research and development in this area.",

        "dc:description": "In the last two decades, artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed the way in which we consume and analyse sports. The role of AI in improving decision-making and forecasting in sports, amongst many other advantages, is rapidly expanding and gaining more attention in both the academic sector and the industry. Nonetheless, for many sports audiences, professionals and policy makers, who are not particularly au courant or experts in AI, the connexion between artificial intelligence and sports remains fuzzy. Likewise, for many, the motivations for adopting a machine learning (ML) paradigm in sports analytics are still either faint or unclear. In this perspective paper, we present a high-level, non-technical, overview of the machine learning paradigm that motivates its potential for enhancing sports (performance and business) analytics. We provide a summary of some relevant research literature on the areas in which artificial intelligence and machine learning have been applied to the sports industry and in sport research. Finally, we present some hypothetical scenarios of how AI and ML could shape the future of sports.",

Accelerating environmental deterioration triggers the scientific community to invest and formulate policies and strategies for environmental management, which will lead to sustainable development. Among all environmental issues solid waste management pose serious threat considering the increase in amount of generation of waste in all economies. Better management strategies and policies are required to ensure better living conditions. Incorporation of AI based models to assist the human efforts not only ensure better management of waste but also aid in reduced carbon emissions.

This paper studies the effects of AI on structural change and factor income shares. As a general purpose technology and new infrastructure, AI may substitute either labor or capital and its application has differential prospects across sectors. With a multi-sector general dynamic equilibrium model, we find that AI services or AI-specific technologies will reallocate factors between sectors. The direction of the reallocation depends on sectoral differences in the output elasticity of AI and in the elasticity of substitution between AI and traditional modes of production. The process of structural change will in turn change the labor income share. This paper presents the theoretical conditions for the direction of these changes and the underlying economic mechanism. We derive policy implications about how to promote high-quality development with AI.",

Communities can largely reduce their hazard vulnerabilities and increase their social resilience through design and planning, which could put cities on a trajectory for long-term stability. However, the silos within the design and planning communities and the gap between research and practice have made it difficult to achieve the goal for a flood resilient environment. Therefore, this paper suggests an AI (Artificial Intelligence)-driven platform to facilitate the flood resilience design and planning. This platform, with the active engagement of local residents, experts, policy makers, and practitioners, will break the aforementioned silos and close the knowledge gaps, which ultimately increases public awareness, improves collaboration effectiveness, and achieves the best design and planning outcomes. We suggest a holistic and integrated approach, bringing multiple disciplines (architectural design, landscape architecture, urban planning, geography, and computer science), and examining the pressing resilient issues at the macro, meso, and micro scales.",

        "dc:description": "The publication of the UK’s National Artificial Intelligence (AI) Strategy represents a step-change in the national industrial, policy, regulatory, and geo-strategic agenda. Although there is a multiplicity of threads to explore this text can be read primarily as a ‘signalling’ document. Indeed, we read the National AI Strategy as a vision for innovation and opportunity, underpinned by a trust framework that has innovation and opportunity at the forefront. We provide an overview of the structure of the document and offer an emphasised commentary on various standouts. Our main takeaways are: Innovation First: a clear signal is that innovation is at the forefront of UK’s data priorities. Alternative Ecosystem of Trust: the UK’s regulatory-market norms becoming the preferred ecosystem is dependent upon the regulatory system and delivery frameworks required. Defence, Security and Risk: security and risk are discussed in terms of utilisation of AI and governance. Revision of Data Protection: the signal is that the UK is indeed seeking to position itself as less stringent regarding data protection and necessary documentation. EU Disalignment—Atlanticism?: questions are raised regarding a step back in terms of data protection rights. We conclude with further notes on data flow continuity, the feasibility of a sector approach to regulation, legal liability, and the lack of a method of engagement for stakeholders. Whilst the strategy sends important signals for innovation, achieving ethical innovation is a harder challenge and will require a carefully evolved framework built with appropriate expertise.",

        "dc:description": "[Objectives]The existing combat deduction simulation system mainly implements decision-making based on operational rules and experience knowledge, and it has certain problems such as limited application scenarios, low decision-making efficiency and poor flexibility. In view of the shortcomings of conventional decision-making methods, an intelligent decision-making model based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technology is proposed. [Methods]First, the maximum entropy Markov decision process（MDP） of simulation deduction is established, and then the agent training network is constructed on the basis of actor-critic architecture to generate randomization policies that improve the agent's exploration ability. At the same time, the soft policy iterative updating method is used to search for better policies and continuously improve the agent's decision-making level. Finally, the simulation is carried out on the Mozi AI platform to validate the model. [Results]The results show that an agent trained with the improved soft actor-critic (SAC) decision-making algorithm can achieve autonomous decision-making. Compared with the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm, the probability of winning is increased by 24.53%. [Conclusions]The design scheme of this decision-making model can provide theoretical references for research on intelligent decision-making technology, giving it some reference significance for warfare simulation and deduction.",

This paper examines the reasons for the discourse's success and its political and social implications. Based on the analysis of policy documents and the media coverage, I argue that political and economic elites have actively introduced the 4IR discourse to create novel momentum for promoting Information and Communications Technology (ICT) and to justify deregulatory measures while re-enacting the developmentalist imaginary. I also highlight that the 4IR discourse's promoters have drawn upon the dialectics between the desirable future and the nation's shared fear to urge the Korean society to accept the measures privileging the industry as the means of making the nation a developed country and avoiding being colonized again.",

        "dc:description": "The field of machine learning (ML) is sufficiently young that it is still expanding at an accelerating pace, lying at the crossroads of computer science and statistics, and at the core of artificial intelligence (AI) and data science. Recent progress in ML has been driven both by the development of new learning algorithms theory, and by the ongoing explosion in the availability of vast amount of data (often referred to as “big data”) and low-cost computation. The adoption of ML-based approaches can be found throughout science, technology and industry, leading to more evidence-based decision-making across many walks of life, including healthcare, biomedicine, manufacturing, education, financial modeling, data governance, policing, and marketing. Although the past decade has witnessed the increasing interest in these fields, we are just beginning to tap the potential of these ML algorithms for studying systems that improve with experience. In this paper, we present a comprehensive view on geo worldwide trends (taking into account China, the USA, Israel, Italy, the UK, and the Middle East) of ML-based approaches highlighting rapid growth in the last 5 years attributable to the introduction of related national policies. Furthermore, based on the literature review, we also discuss the potential research directions in this field, summarizing some popular application areas of machine learning technology, such as healthcare, cyber-security systems, sustainable agriculture, data governance, and nanotechnology, suggesting that the “dissemination of research” in the ML scientific community has undergone the exceptional growth in the time range of 2018–2020, reaching a value of 16,339 publications. Finally, we report the challenges and the regulatory standpoints for managing ML technology. Overall, we hope that this work will help to explain the geo trends of ML approaches and their applicability in various real-world domains, as well as serve as a reference point for both academia and industry professionals, particularly from a technical, ethical and regulatory point of view.",

        "dc:description": "With the rapid development of society and industry, novel technologies and materials related to pavement engineering are constantly emerging. However, with the continuous improvement of people’s demands, pavement engineering also faces more and more enormous challenges that the pavement materials must have excellent engineering properties and environmental benefits. Meanwhile, the intelligence is the mainstream development direction of modern society, and the development trend of future transportation infrastructure. Materials Genome Initiative, a program for the development of new materials that materials design is conducted by up-front simulations and predictions, followed by key validation experiments, the rapid development of science and technology and AI toolset (big data and machine learning) provide new opportunities and strong technical supports for pavement materials development that shorten the development-application cycle of new material, reduce cost and promote the application of new carriers such as intelligent sensing components in transportation engineering, to achieve the intelligence of transportation engineering. However, traditional pavement materials possess several unavoidable shortcomings, indicating that it is exceedingly difficult for them to meet the above requirements for future pavement materials. Therefore, the development of future new pavement materials, which can be designed on-demand as well as possessing enough mechanical properties, high durability, practical functionality, and high environmental protection, is urgent. In recent years, as a “designable” polymer material with various excellent engineering performances, polyurethane (PU) has been widely applied in pavement practices by changing the chemical structures of raw materials and their mix proportions, for instance pavement repairing material, permeable pavement material, tunnel paving material and bridge deck paving materials, etc. Although PU material has been widely applied in practices, a systematically summarization is still quite necessary for further understanding the working mechanism of PU materials and optimization it’s engineering applications. To fill the gap, this article puts forward the special requirements for future transportation infrastructure materials, and introduces the basic properties and working mechanism of PU materials in order to make up for the defects of conventional road materials. Based on this, this article also summarizes the engineering performances and environmental benefits of applying PU as the binder for different road infrastructure materials in recent years. Considering the gene-editable nature of polyurethane, further research of the on-demand design principles of PU pavement materials is recommended. The establishment of raw material gene database, material terminal performance database and their structure-activity relationship are highlighted. The current research is essential to the practice guidance and further optimization of the PU materials for road infrastructures, which in line with the future Carbon neutral policy.",

        "dc:description": "Although rates of vaccination have increased worldwide, the rise in nonmedical exemptions for vaccination may have caused a resurgence of childhood vaccine-preventable diseases. Vaccine hesitancy plays an important role in the decreasing rates of vaccination and is considered by the World Health Organization as a top ten global threat to public health. Online vaccine misinformation is present in news outlets, websites, and social media, and its rapid and extensive dissemination is aided by artificial intelligence (AI). In combating online misinformation, public health experts, the medical community, and lay vaccination advocates can correct false statements using language that appeal to those who are undecided about vaccination. As the gatekeepers to online information, they can implement and enforce policy that limits or bans vaccine misinformation on their platforms. AI tools might also be used to address misinformation, but more research is needed before implementing this approach more broadly in health policy. This commentary examines the role that different online platforms appear to be playing in the spread of misinformation about vaccines. We also discuss the implications of online misinformation on attitudes about COVID-19 vaccine uptake and provide suggestions for ways to combat online misinformation.",

        "dc:description": "Disruptive technologies and the domination of digital platforms have challenged the global economy players twice — first, to get a hand on them, then to mitigate the possible risks. It is beyond doubt that reliable artificial intelligence (AI) can bring many benefits at the European level, such as better health care, safer and cleaner transport, more efficient manufacturing, and sustainable energy. But regulating the unknown requires considerable effort on how to attract investors using clear rules while keeping human control over the algorithms as a priority. In April 2021, the EU Commission published a holistic proposal to regulate the use of AI, which promises to put trust first and ensure that facial recognition and big data operators will never abuse fundamental human rights. Although the proposal is likely to be amended during EU-wide discussions, the new approach to AI will clearly give citizens the reassurance to adopt these technologies while encouraging companies to develop them. Hence, this article aims to map the core challenges for the EU policy on the use of AI, as well as the milestones of developing the holistic legislative proposal, and clarify if the afore-mentioned proposal indeed solves all the AI-related risks for future generations.",

        "dc:description": "Objectives Different stakeholders may hold varying attitudes towards artificial intelligence (AI) applications in healthcare, which may constrain their acceptance if AI developers fail to take them into account. We set out to ascertain evidence of the attitudes of clinicians, consumers, managers, researchers, regulators and industry towards AI applications in healthcare. Methods We undertook an exploratory analysis of articles whose titles or abstracts contained the terms € artificial intelligence' or € AI' and € medical' or € healthcare' and € attitudes', € perceptions', € opinions', € views', € expectations'. Using a snowballing strategy, we searched PubMed and Google Scholar for articles published 1 January 2010 through 31 May 2021. We selected articles relating to non-robotic clinician-facing AI applications used to support healthcare-related tasks or decision-making. Results Across 27 studies, attitudes towards AI applications in healthcare, in general, were positive, more so for those with direct experience of AI, but provided certain safeguards were met. AI applications which automated data interpretation and synthesis were regarded more favourably by clinicians and consumers than those that directly influenced clinical decisions or potentially impacted clinician-patient relationships. Privacy breaches and personal liability for AI-related error worried clinicians, while loss of clinician oversight and inability to fully share in decision-making worried consumers. Both clinicians and consumers wanted AI-generated advice to be trustworthy, while industry groups emphasised AI benefits and wanted more data, funding and regulatory certainty. Discussion Certain expectations of AI applications were common to many stakeholder groups from which a set of dependencies can be defined. Conclusion Stakeholders differ in some but not all of their attitudes towards AI. Those developing and implementing applications should consider policies and processes that bridge attitudinal disconnects between different stakeholders.",

        "dc:description": "Background: Certain types of artificial intelligence (AI), that is, deep learning models, can outperform health care professionals in particular domains. Such models hold considerable promise for improved diagnostics, treatment, and prevention, as well as more cost-efficient health care. They are, however, opaque in the sense that their exact reasoning cannot be fully explicated. Different stakeholders have emphasized the importance of the transparency/explainability of AI decision making. Transparency/explainability may come at the cost of performance. There is need for a public policy regulating the use of AI in health care that balances the societal interests in high performance as well as in transparency/explainability. A public policy should consider the wider public's interests in such features of AI. Objective: This study elicited the public's preferences for the performance and explainability of AI decision making in health care and determined whether these preferences depend on respondent characteristics, including trust in health and technology and fears and hopes regarding AI. Methods: We conducted a choice-based conjoint survey of public preferences for attributes of AI decision making in health care in a representative sample of the adult Danish population. Initial focus group interviews yielded 6 attributes playing a role in the respondents' views on the use of AI decision support in health care: (1) type of AI decision, (2) level of explanation, (3) performance/accuracy, (4) responsibility for the final decision, (5) possibility of discrimination, and (6) severity of the disease to which the AI is applied. In total, 100 unique choice sets were developed using fractional factorial design. In a 12-task survey, respondents were asked about their preference for AI system use in hospitals in relation to 3 different scenarios. Results: Of the 1678 potential respondents, 1027 (61.2%) participated. The respondents consider the physician having the final responsibility for treatment decisions the most important attribute, with 46.8% of the total weight of attributes, followed by explainability of the decision (27.3%) and whether the system has been tested for discrimination (14.8%). Other factors, such as gender, age, level of education, whether respondents live rurally or in towns, respondents' trust in health and technology, and respondents' fears and hopes regarding AI, do not play a significant role in the majority of cases. Conclusions: The 3 factors that are most important to the public are, in descending order of importance, (1) that physicians are ultimately responsible for diagnostics and treatment planning, (2) that the AI decision support is explainable, and (3) that the AI system has been tested for discrimination. Public policy on AI system use in health care should give priority to such AI system use and ensure that patients are provided with information.",

Objective: This study aimed to explore how clinicians perceive AI assistance in diagnostic decision making and suggest the paths forward for AI-human teaming for clinical decision making in health care. Methods: This study used a mixed methods approach, utilizing hierarchical linear modeling and sentiment analysis through natural language understanding techniques. Results: A total of 114 clinicians participated in online simulation surveys in 2020 and 2021. These clinicians studied family medicine and used AI algorithms to aid in patient diagnosis. Their overall sentiment toward AI-assisted diagnosis was positive and comparable with diagnoses made without the assistance of AI. However, AI-guided decision making was not congruent with the way clinicians typically made decisions in diagnosing illnesses. In a quantitative survey, clinicians reported perceiving current AI assistance as not likely to enhance diagnostic capability and negatively influenced their overall performance (β=-0.421, P=.02). Instead, clinicians' diagnostic capabilities tended to be associated with well-known parameters, such as education, age, and daily habit of technology use on social media platforms. Conclusions: This study elucidated clinicians' current perceptions and sentiments toward AI-enabled diagnosis. Although the sentiment was positive, the current form of AI assistance may not be linked with efficient decision making, as AI algorithms are not well aligned with subjective human reasoning in clinical diagnosis. Developers and policy makers in health could gather behavioral data from clinicians in various disciplines to help align AI algorithms with the unique subjective patterns of reasoning that humans employ in clinical diagnosis.",

        "dc:description": "In turning operations, the wear of cutting tools is inevitable. As workpieces produced with worn tools may fail to meet specifications, the machining industries focus on replacement policies that mitigate the risk of losses due to scrap. Several strategies, from empiric laws to more advanced statistical models, have been proposed in the literature. More recently, many monitoring systems based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have been developed. Due to the scope of different artificial intelligence approaches, having a holistic view of the state of the art on this subject is complex, in part due to a lack of recent comprehensive reviews. This literature review therefore presents 20 years of literature on this subject obtained following a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) methodology. This SLR aims to answer the following research question: “How is the AI used in the framework of monitoring/predicting the condition of tools in stable turning condition?” To answer this research question, the “Scopus” database was consulted in order to gather relevant publications published between 1 January 2000 and 1 January 2021. The systematic approach yielded 8426 articles among which 102 correspond to the inclusion and exclusion criteria which limit the application of AI to stable turning operation and online prediction. A bibliometric analysis performed on these articles highlighted the growing interest of this subject in the recent years. A more in-depth analysis of the articles is also presented, mainly focusing on six AI techniques that are highly represented in the literature: Artificial Neural Network (ANN), fuzzy logic, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Self-Organizing Map (SOM), Hidden Markov Model (HMM), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). For each technique, the trends in the inputs, pre-processing techniques, and outputs of the AI are presented. The trends highlight the early and continuous importance of ANN, and the emerging interest of CNN for tool condition monitoring. The lack of common benchmark database for evaluating models performance does not allow clear comparisons of technique performance.",

This is not new nor is this tension likely to change anytime soon given the increasing speed at which embryonic technologies are emerging into the market [2]. Some of these technologies, such as autonomous vehicles or drones, can be effectively regulated at the national level due to clearly defined jurisdictional boundaries and the existence of relevant national and state/provincial regulatory agencies that oversee their conventional counterparts. While the entry of these technologies into the market will challenge regulators and policymakers and may require tweaking of existing regimes, we argue that these technologies, and the products that they enable, will not require a sui generis response at the national and supranational levels. The same cannot be said for artificial intelligence (AI) and the myriad of interconnected and interwoven applications made possible by AI.",

        "dc:description": "Artificial intelligence (AI) applications are diverse and serve varied functions in clinical practice. The most successful products today are clinical decision tools used by physicians, but autonomous AI is gaining traction. Widespread use of AI is limited in part because of concerns about bias, fault-tolerance, and specificity. Adoption of AI often depends on removing cost and complexity in clinical workflow integration, providing clear incentives for use, and providing clear demonstration of clinical outcome. Existing wide-angle photographic screening could be integrated into the clinical workflow based on prior implementations for premature babies and linked with AI interpretation with existing technology. Incidence of retinal abnormality, clinical considerations, AI performance, grading variation for AI-augmented human grading, and cost and policy aspects play a significant role. Improved outcomes for newborns and a relatively high estimated incidence of abnormality have been named as benefits to counterweigh costs in the long term.",

        "dc:description": "Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in power grid control and energy management in building automation require both deep Q-networks (DQNs) and deep deterministic policy gradients (DDPGs) in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) as off-policy algorithms. Most studies on improving the stability of DRL have addressed these with replay buffers and a target network using a delayed temporal difference (TD) backup, which is known for minimizing a loss function at every iteration. The loss functions were developed for DQN and DDPG, and it is well-known that there have been few studies on improving the techniques of the loss functions used in both DQN and DDPG. Therefore, we modified the loss function based on a temporal consistency (TC) loss and adapted the proposed TC loss function for the target network update in both DQN and DDPG. The proposed TC loss function showed effective results, particularly in a critic network in DDPG. In this work, we demonstrate that, in OpenAI Gym, both “cart-pole” and “pendulum”, the proposed TC loss function shows enormously improved convergence speed and performance, particularly in the critic network in DDPG.",

        "dc:description": "Global economic growth, demographic explosion, digitization, increased mobility, and greater demand for heating and cooling due to climate change in different world areas are the main drivers for the surge in energy demand. The increase in energy demand is the basis of economic challenges for power companies alongside several socio-economic problems in communities, such as energy poverty, defined as the insufficient coverage of energy needs, especially in the residential sector. Two main strategies are considered to meet this increased demand. The first strategy focuses on new sustainable and eco-friendly modes of power generation, such as renewable energy resources and distributed energy resources. The second strategy is demand-side oriented rather than the supply side. Demand-side management, demand response (DR), and energy efficiency (EE) programs fall under this category. On the other hand, the decentralization and digitization of the energy sector convoyed by the emersion of new technologies such as blockchain, Internet of Things (IoT), and Artificial Intelligence (AI), opened the door to new solutions for the energy demand dilemma. Among these technologies, blockchain has proved itself as a decentralized trading platform between untrusted peers without the involvement of a trusted third party. This newly introduced Peer-to-Peer (P2P) trading model can be used to create a new demand load control model. In this article, the concept of an energy cap and trade demand-side management (DSM) model is introduced and simulated. The introduced DSM model is based on the concept of capping consumers’ monthly energy consumption and rewarding consumers who do not exceed this cap with energy tradeable credits that can be traded using blockchain-based Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading. A model based on 200 households is used to simulate the proposed DSM model and prove that this model can be beneficial to both energy companies and consumers.",

        "dc:description": "The increasing role of emerging technologies, such as big data, the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence (AI), cognitive technologies, cloud computing, and mobile technologies, is essential to the business process manager profession’s sustainable development. Nevertheless, these technologies could involve new challenges in labor markets. The era of intelligent business process management (BPM) has begun, but how does it look in real labor markets? This paper examines the hypothesis that the transformation of the business process manager profession has been caused by certain determinants that involve the need for an improvement in BPM skills. The main contribution is a model of the dimensions of the impact of digital technologies on business process management supplemented with skills that influence the business process manager profession. The paper fills the gap in research on perspectives of the impact of digital technologies on business process management, considering both a literature analysis and labor market research. The purpose of the literature review was to identify the core dimensions that drive the use of emerging technologies in business process management. The labor market study was conducted in order to analyze the current demand for core skills of business process managers in the Polish labor market with a particular emphasis on the intelligent BPM concept. Additionally, to study the determinants that slow down the iBPM concept’s development, the digital intensity level of the enterprises and public administration units in Poland was studied. Finally, a fuzzy cognitive map presenting the core determinants of the business process manager profession’s transformation is described.",

Therefore, DT are relevant contributors for sustainable development goal (SDG) achievements. This study aims to com-pare the preference for artificial intelligence‐driven digital technologies (AI‐Driven DT) to achieve SDGs in Brazil and Portugal. An independent sample t‐test analysis and Levene test are performed to identify potential artificial intelligence‐driven digital technologies (AI‐Driven DT) as favorable facilitators for SDG achievements in Brazil and Portugal. Based on the findings, a broader analysis is provided, to (i) indicate potential favorable SDGs, (ii) discuss differences between the countries in AI‐Driven DT preferences in each SDG, and (iii) make recommendations for potential technologies that could receive more attention and investments in both regions to make emergent digital technologies succeed, with a particular emphasis on cleaner production. The analysis is organized into three dimensions: economic, social, and environment. At the end, a closing discussion is provided about the key guidelines and prospects that could be adopted to keep a strong and positive shift of AI‐Driven DT developments and applications towards fully supporting the attainment of the SDG of United Nations Organization (ONU) Agenda 2030.",

        "dc:description": "The emergence of new technologies and the era of IoT which will be based on compute-intensive applications. These applications will increase the traffic volume of today’s network infras-tructure and will impact more on emerging Fifth Generation (5G) system. Research is going in many details, such as how to provide automation in managing and configuring data analysis tasks over cloud and edges, and to achieve minimum latency and bandwidth consumption with optimizing task allocation. The major challenge for researchers is to push the artificial intelligence to the edge to fully discover the potential of the fog computing paradigm. There are existing intelligence-based fog computing frameworks for IoT based applications, but research on Edge-Artificial Intelligence (Edge-AI) is still in its initial stage. Therefore, we chose to focus on data analytics and offloading in our proposed architecture. To address these problems, we have proposed a prototype of our architecture, which is a multi-layered architecture for data analysis between cloud and fog computing layers to perform latency-sensitive analysis with low latency. The main goal of this research is to use this multi-layer fog computing platform for enhancement of data analysis system based on IoT devices in real-time. Our research based on the policy of the OpenFog Consortium which will offer the good outcomes, but also surveillance and data analysis functionalities. We presented through case studies that our proposed prototype architecture outperformed the cloud-only environment in delay-time, network usage, and energy consumption.",

At the core of AI are well-defined areas, such as machine learning, natural language processing, artificial neural networks, and computer vision. Although research and development of AI in health care is being conducted in many medical subspecialties, only a few applications have been implemented in clinical practice. This is true in vascular surgery, where applications are mostly in the translational research stage. These AI applications are being evaluated in the realms of vascular diagnostics, perioperative medicine, risk stratification, and outcome prediction, among others. Apart from the technical challenges of AI and research outcomes on safe and beneficial use in patient care, ethical issues and policy surrounding AI will present future challenges for its successful implementation. This review will give a brief overview and a basic understanding of AI and summarize the currently available and used clinical AI applications in vascular surgery.",

        "dc:description": "The process of digitizing radio is far from over. It is an important interdisciplinary aspect, involving Big Data and AI (Artificial Intelligence) when it comes to classifying and handling content, and an organizational challenge in the Industry 4.0 concept. There exist several methods for delivering audio signals, including terrestrial broadcasting and internet streaming. Among them, the DAB+ (Digital Audio Broadcasting plus) system is one of the leading standards of terrestrial digital radio transmission. Compared with analog FM (frequency modulation) radio, it is more bandwidth efficient and offers greater possibilities when it comes to delivering content and forming an ensemble and multiplex. Currently, many countries worldwide, particularly European States, are still making adjustments in order to perform an efficient switchover from analog FM to digital DAB+ radio. This paper presents the current situation of the digital radio market as well as the results of a subjective quality evaluation study and questionnaire concerning broadcasting in both digital and analog techniques. It involves radio programs, transmitting both speech and music signals, simulcasted in DAB+ and FM standards. It also presents the development of the national multiplex. The results of this study may help both researchers and scientists as well as policy makers and professionals active in the field of broadcasting and electronic media and not to mention the consumption of multimedia content.",

        "dc:description": "Policies shape society. Public health policies are of particular importance, as they often dictate matters in life and death. Accumulating evidence indicates that good-intentioned COVID-19 policies, such as shelter-in-place measures, can often result in unintended consequences among vulnerable populations such as nursing home residents and domestic violence victims. Thus, to shed light on the issue, this study aimed to identify policy-making processes that have the potential of developing policies that could induce optimal desirable outcomes with limited to no unintended consequences amid the pandemic and beyond. Methods: A literature review was conducted in Pub-Med, PsycINFO, and Scopus to answer the research question. To better structure the review and the subsequent analysis, theoretical frameworks such as the social ecological model were adopted to guide the process. Results: The findings suggested that: (1) people-centered; (2) artificial intelligence (AI)-powered; (3) data-driven, and (4) supervision-enhanced policy-making processes could help society develop policies that have the potential to yield desirable outcomes with limited unintended consequences. To leverage these strategies’ interconnectedness, the people-centered, AI-powered, data-driven, and supervision-enhanced (PADS) model of policy making was subsequently devel-oped. Conclusion: The PADS model can develop policies that have the potential to induce optimal outcomes and limit or eliminate unintended consequences amid COVID-19 and beyond. Rather than serving as a definitive answer to problematic COVID-19 policy-making practices, the PADS model could be best understood as one of many promising frameworks that could bring the pandemic policy-making process more in line with the interests of societies at large; in other words, more cost-effectively, and consistently anti-COVID and pro-human.",

Just as AI seeks to mirror human cognition through its data-driven analytics, it can also reflect the biases present in our collective conscience. In this Viewpoint, we use past and counterfactual examples to illustrate the sequelae of unmitigated bias in healthcare artificial intelligence. Past examples indicate that if the benefits of emerging AI technologies are to be realized, consensus around the regulation of algorithmic bias at the policy level is needed to ensure their ethical integration into the health system. This paper puts forth regulatory strategies for uprooting bias in healthcare AI that can inform ongoing efforts to establish a framework for federal oversight. We highlight three overarching oversight principles in bias mitigation that maps to each phase of the algorithm life cycle.",

This article provides a comparative analysis of the European Union (EU) and the United States’ (US) AI strategies and considers (i) the visions of a ‘Good AI Society’ that are forwarded in key policy documents and their opportunity costs, (ii) the extent to which the implementation of each vision is living up to stated aims and (iii) the consequences that these differing visions of a ‘Good AI Society’ have for transatlantic cooperation. The article concludes by comparing the ethical desirability of each vision and identifies areas where the EU, and especially the US, need to improve in order to achieve ethical outcomes and deepen cooperation.",

        "dc:description": "Robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) are revolutionizing all spheres of human life. From industrial processes to graphic design, the implementation of automated intelligent systems is changing how industries work. The spread of robots and AI systems has triggered academic institutions to closely examine how these technologies may affect the humanity—this is how the fields of roboethics and AI ethics have been born. The identification of ethical issues for robotics and AI and creation of ethical frameworks were the first steps to creating a regulatory environment for these technologies. In this paper, we focus on regulatory efforts in Europe and North America to create enforceable regulation for AI and robotics. We describe and compare ethical principles, policies, and regulations that have been proposed by government organizations for the design and use of robots and AI. We also discuss proposed international regulation for robotics and AI. This paper tries to highlight the need for a comprehensive, enforceable, and agile policy to ethically regulate technology today and in the future. Through reviewing existing policies, we conclude that the European Unition currently leads the way in defining roboethics and AI ethical principles and implementing them into policy. Our findings suggest that governments in Europe and North America are aware of the ethical risks that robotics and AI pose, and are engaged in policymaking to create regulatory policies for these new technologies.",

        "dc:description": "Abnormal behavior in mobile cellular networks can cause network faults and consequent cell outages, a major reason for operational cost increase and revenue loss for operators. Nonetheless, network faults and cell outages can be avoided by monitoring abnormal situations in the network and acting accordingly. Thus, anomaly detection is an important component of self-healing control and network management. Network operators may use the detected abnormal behavior to quantify numerically their intensity. The quantification of abnormal behavior assists the characterization of potential regions for infrastructure updates and to support the creation of public policies for local connectivity enhancements. We propose an unsupervised learning solution for anomaly detection in mobile networks using Call Detail Records (CDR) data. We evaluate our solution using a real CDR data set provided by an Italian operator and compare it against other state-of-the-art solutions, showing a performance improvement of around 35%. We also demonstrate the relevance of considering the distinct traffic patterns of diverging geographic areas for anomaly detection in mobile networks, an aspect often ignored in the literature.",

As it enables fast inference and distributed learning, edge intelligence is envisioned to be an important component of 6G networks. In this article, we investigate AI service provisioning for supporting edge intelligence. First, we present the features and requirements of AI services. Then we introduce AI service data management and customize network slicing for AI services. Specifically, we propose a novel resource-pooling method to regularize service data exchange within the network edge while allocating network resources for AI services. Using this method, network resources can be properly allocated to network slices to fulfill AI service requirements. A trace-driven case study demonstrates that the proposed method can allow network slicing to satisfy diverse AI service performance requirements via the flexible selection of resource-pooling policies. In this tudy, we illustrate the necessity, challenge, and potential of AI service provisioning on the network edge and provide insights into resource management for AI services.",

        "dc:description": "This paper assesses leading Japanese philosophical thought since the onset of Japan’s modernity: namely, from the Meiji Restoration (1868) onwards. It argues that there are lessons of global value for AI ethics to be found from examining leading Japanese philosophers of modernity and ethics (Yukichi Fukuzawa, Nishida Kitaro, Nishi Amane, and Watsuji Tetsurō), each of whom engaged closely with Western philosophical traditions. Turning to these philosophers allows us to advance from what are broadly individualistically and Western-oriented ethical debates regarding emergent technologies that function in relation to AI, by introducing notions of community, wholeness, sincerity, and heart. With reference to AI that pertains to profile, judge, learn, and interact with human emotion (emotional AI), this paper contends that (a) Japan itself may internally make better use of historic indigenous ethical thought, especially as it applies to question of data and relationships with technology; but also (b) that externally Western and global ethical discussion regarding emerging technologies will find valuable insights from Japan. The paper concludes by distilling from Japanese philosophers of modernity four ethical suggestions, or spices, in relation to emerging technological contexts for Japan’s national AI policies and international fora, such as standards development and global AI ethics policymaking.",

After outlining the overall policy and institutional setting preceding both proposals, the article presents a comparative exercise between the Commission’s proposal and the Parliament’s legislative report on regulating the ethical aspects of AI to which the former is responding. It thereby concludes that the draft AI Act, albeit in its initial stages, already demonstrates the added value of granting the Parliament a direct right of legislative initiative, especially where the proposal draws significant inspiration from its unprecedented work on complex questions.",

        "dc:description": "The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the global need for reliable models of disease spread. We propose an AI-augmented forecast modeling framework that provides daily predictions of the expected number of confirmed COVID-19 deaths, cases, and hospitalizations during the following 4 weeks. We present an international, prospective evaluation of our models’ performance across all states and counties in the USA and prefectures in Japan. Nationally, incident mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for predicting COVID-19 associated deaths during prospective deployment remained consistently <8% (US) and <29% (Japan), while cumulative MAPE remained <2% (US) and <10% (Japan). We show that our models perform well even during periods of considerable change in population behavior, and are robust to demographic differences across different geographic locations. We further demonstrate that our framework provides meaningful explanatory insights with the models accurately adapting to local and national policy interventions. Our framework enables counterfactual simulations, which indicate continuing Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions alongside vaccinations is essential for faster recovery from the pandemic, delaying the application of interventions has a detrimental effect, and allow exploration of the consequences of different vaccination strategies. The COVID-19 pandemic remains a global emergency. In the face of substantial challenges ahead, the approach presented here has the potential to inform critical decisions.",

        "dc:description": "Background: Racial and ethnic minorities in the US have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and are at risk for disparities in COVID-19 vaccinations. The H1N1 flu vaccine experience provides lessons learned to address and prevent racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 vaccinations. We aim to identify racial/ethnic and geographic disparities in H1N1 vaccinations among Medicaid enrollees to inform equitable COVID-19 vaccination policies and strategies. Methods: The study population included people under 65 who were continuously enrolled in Medicaid in 2009 and 2010 from 28 states and the District of Columbia. H1N1 vaccinations were identified from Medicaid outpatient claims. Vaccination rates were calculated for the overall sample and subpopulations by race/ethnicity and state. Results: 3,708,894 (12.3%) Medicaid enrollees in the sample were vaccinated for H1N1 in 2009–2010. Race-specific vaccination rates ranged from 8.1% in American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) to 19.8% in Asian/Pacific Islander Medicaid enrollees. NHB enrollees had lower vaccination rates than non-Hispanic White (NHW) enrollees in all states, with the exceptions of Maryland, Missouri, Ohio, and Washington. The largest disparity between NHB and NHW was in Pennsylvania (1.0% vs. 7.0%), while the largest absolute difference between NHB and NHW enrollees was in Georgia (17.4% vs. 30.7%). Conclusions: Our study found huge variation in H1N1 vaccinations across states and racial/ethnic disparities in H1N1 vaccinations within states. In most states, NHB and AI/AN Medicaid enrollees had lower vaccination rates than Whites. Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islander Medicaid enrollees in most states had higher vaccination rates than Whites.",

Many efficiencies and improvements are likely, but there are also potential dangers, including the threat of harmful impacts on third parties, discriminatory practices, data and privacy breaches, fraudulent practices and even ‘rogue AI’. To address these dangers, the EU published ‘The Expert Group’s Policy and Investment Recommendations for Trustworthy AI’ (the Guidelines). The Guidelines produce seven principles from its four foundational pillars of respect for human autonomy, prevention of harm, fairness, and explicability. If implemented by business, the impact on corporate governance will be substantial. Fundamental questions at the intersection of ethics and law are considered, but because the Guidelines only address the former without (much) reference to the latter, their practical application is challenging for business. Further, while they promote many positive corporate governance principles—including a stakeholder-oriented (‘human-centric’) corporate purpose and diversity, non-discrimination, and fairness—it is clear that their general nature leaves many questions and concerns unanswered. In this paper we examine the potential significance and impact of the Guidelines on selected corporate law and governance issues. We conclude that more specificity is needed in relation to how the principles therein will harmonise with company law rules and governance principles. However, despite their imperfections, until harder legislative instruments emerge, the Guidelines provide a useful starting point for directing businesses towards establishing trustworthy AI.",

Since 2016, a great many organizations have pledged allegiance to such principles. Amongst them are 24 AI companies that did so by posting a commitment of the kind on their website and/or by joining the ‘Partnership on AI’. By means of a comprehensive web search, two questions are addressed by this study: (1) Did the signatory companies actually try to implement these principles in practice, and if so, how? (2) What are their views on the role of other societal actors in steering AI towards the stated principles (the issue of regulation)? It is concluded that some three of the largest amongst them have carried out valuable steps towards implementation, in particular by developing and open sourcing new software tools. To them, charges of mere ‘ethics washing’ do not apply. Moreover, some 10 companies from both the USA and Europe have publicly endorsed the position that apart from self-regulation, AI is in urgent need of governmental regulation. They mostly advocate focussing regulation on high-risk applications of AI, a policy which to them represents the sensible middle course between laissez-faire on the one hand and outright bans on technologies on the other. The future shaping of standards, ethical codes, and laws as a result of these regulatory efforts remains, of course, to be determined.",

        "dc:description": "Background: The inclusion of protective factors (“assets”) are increasingly supported in developing culturally grounded interventions for American Indian (AI) populations. This study sought to explore AI women’s cultural assets, perspectives, and teachings to inform the development of a culturally grounded, intergenerational intervention to prevent substance abuse and teenage pregnancy among AI females. Methods: Adult self-identified AI women (N = 201) who reside on the Navajo Nation completed a cross-sectional survey between May and October 2018. The 21-question survey explored health communication around the transition to womanhood, cultural assets, perceptions of mother–daughter reproductive health communication, and intervention health topics. Univariate descriptive analyses, chi squared, and fisher’s exact tests were conducted. Results: Respondents ranged in age from 18 to 82 years, with a mean age of 44 ± 15.5 years. Women self-identified as mothers (95; 48%), aunts (59; 30%), older sisters (55; 28%), grandmothers (37; 19%), and/or all of the aforementioned (50; 25%). 66% (N = 95) of women admired their mother/grandmother most during puberty; 29% (N = 58) of women were 10–11 years old when someone first spoke to them about menarche; and 86% (N=172) felt their culture was a source of strength. 70% (N = 139) would have liked to learn more about reproductive health when they were a teenager; 67% (N = 134) felt Diné mothers are able to provide reproductive health education; 51% (N = 101) reported having a rite of passage event, with younger women desiring an event significantly more than older women. Responses also indicate a disruption of cultural practices due to government assimilation policies, as well as the support of male relatives during puberty. Conclusions: Results informed intervention content and delivery, including target age group, expanded caregiver eligibility criteria, lesson delivery structure and format, and protective cultural teachings. Other implications include the development of a complementary fatherhood and/or family-based intervention to prevent Native girls’ substance use and teen pregnancy.",

        "dc:description": "With the growing applications of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), there is also an increasing demand for its efficient hardware acceleration. Compared with CNN tasks, GCN tasks have new challenges such as randomness, sparsity, and nonuniformity, which will lead to poor performance of previous AI accelerators. In this paper, we propose DyGA, a hardware-efficient GCN accelerator, which is featured by strategies of graph partitioning, customized storage policy, traffic-aware dynamic scheduling, and out-of-order execution. Synthesized and evaluated under TSMC 28-nm, the accelerator achieves an average throughput of over 95% of its peak performance with full utilization of hardware on representative graph data sets. Having a high area-efficiency with 0.217 GOPS/K-logic-gates and 8.06 GOPS/KB-PE-buffer, and thus an energy-efficiency of 384GOPS/W, the proposed accelerator outperforms previous state-of-the-art works in the sparse data processing.",

        "dc:description": "Commoning embodies the product of social contracts and behaviors between groups of individuals. In the case of social housing and the establishment of physical domains for life, commoning is an intersection of these contracts and the restrictions and policies that prohibit and allow them to occur within municipalities. Via a platform-based project entitled Public Parts (2020), this article will also present positions on the reification of the common through a set of design methodologies and implementations of automation. This platform seeks to subvert typical platform models to decrease ownership, increase access, and produce a new form of communal autonomous life amongst individuals that constitute the rapidly expanding freelance, work from home, and gig economies. Furthermore, this text investigates the consequences of merging domestic space with artificial intelligence by implementing machine learning to reconfigure spaces and program. The problems that arise from the deployment of machine learning algorithms involve issues of collection, usage, and ownership of data. Through the physical design of space, and a central AI which manages the platform and the automated management of space, the core objective of Public Parts is to reify the common through architecture and collectively owned data.",

        "dc:description": "Newly emerging infectious diseases, such as the coronavirus (COVID-19), create new challenges for public healthcare systems. Before effective treatments, countering the spread of these infections depends on mitigating, protective behaviours such as social distancing, respecting lockdown, wearing masks, frequent handwashing, travel restrictions, and vaccine acceptance. Previous work has shown that the enacting protective behaviours depends on beliefs about individual vulnerability, threat severity, and one’s ability to engage in such protective actions. However, little is known about the genesis of these beliefs in response to an infectious disease epidemic, and the cognitive mechanisms that may link these beliefs to decision making. Active inference (AI) is a recent approach to behavioural modelling that integrates embodied perception, action, belief updating, and decision making. This approach provides a framework to understand the behaviour of agents in situations that require planning under uncertainty. It assumes that the brain infers the hidden states that cause sensations, predicts the perceptual feedback produced by adaptive actions, and chooses actions that minimize expected surprise in the future. In this paper, we present a computational account describing how individuals update their beliefs about the risks and thereby commit to protective behaviours. We show how perceived risks, beliefs about future states, sensory uncertainty, and outcomes under each policy can determine individual protective behaviours. We suggest that these mechanisms are crucial to assess how individuals cope with uncertainty during a pandemic, and we show the interest of these new perspectives for public health policies.",

        "dc:description": "Background: Palliative care is a medical specialty centered on improving the quality of life (QOL) of patients with complex or life-threatening illnesses. The need for palliative care is increasing and with that the rigorous testing of triage tools that can be used quickly and reliably to identify patients that may benefit from palliative care. Methods: To that aim, we will conduct a two-armed stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial rolled out to two inpatient hospitals to evaluate whether a machine learning algorithm accurately identifies patients who may benefit from a comprehensive review by a palliative care specialist and decreases time to receiving a palliative care consult in hospital. This is a single-center study which will be conducted from August 2019 to November 2020 at Saint Mary’s Hospital & Methodist Hospital both within Mayo Clinic Rochester in Minnesota. Clusters will be nursing units which will be chosen to be a mix of complex patients from Cardiology, Critical Care, and Oncology and had previously established relationships with palliative medicine. The stepped wedge design will have 12 units allocated to a design matrix of 5 treatment wedges. Each wedge will last 75 days resulting in a study period of 12 months of recruitment unless otherwise specified. Data will be analyzed with Bayesian hierarchical models with credible intervals denoting statistical significance. Discussion: This intervention offers a pragmatic approach to delivering specialty palliative care to hospital patients in need using machine learning, thereby leading to high value care and improved outcomes. It is not enough for AI to be utilized by simply publishing research showing predictive performance; clinical trials demonstrating better outcomes are critically needed. Furthermore, the deployment of an AI algorithm is a complex process that requires multiple teams with varying skill sets. To evaluate a deployed AI, a pragmatic clinical trial can accommodate the difficulties of clinical practice while retaining scientific rigor. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03976297.

        "dc:description": "First two decades of the twenty-first century are characterised by epidemics of non-communicable diseases such as many hundreds of millions of patients diagnosed with cardiovascular diseases and the type 2 diabetes mellitus, breast, lung, liver and prostate malignancies, neurological, sleep, mood and eye disorders, amongst others. Consequent socio-economic burden is tremendous. Unprecedented decrease in age of maladaptive individuals has been reported. The absolute majority of expanding non-communicable disorders carry a chronic character, over a couple of years progressing from reversible suboptimal health conditions to irreversible severe pathologies and cascading collateral complications. The time-frame between onset of SHS and clinical manifestation of associated disorders is the operational area for an application of reliable risk assessment tools and predictive diagnostics followed by the cost-effective targeted prevention and treatments tailored to the person. This article demonstrates advanced strategies in bio/medical sciences and healthcare focused on suboptimal health conditions in the frame-work of Predictive, Preventive and Personalised Medicine (3PM/PPPM). Potential benefits in healthcare systems and for society at large include but are not restricted to an improved life-quality of major populations and socio-economical groups, advanced professionalism of healthcare-givers and sustainable healthcare economy. Amongst others, following medical areas are proposed to strongly benefit from PPPM strategies applied to the identification and treatment of suboptimal health conditions:Stress overload associated pathologiesMale and female healthPlanned pregnanciesPeriodontal healthEye disordersInflammatory disorders, wound healing and pain management with associated complicationsMetabolic disorders and suboptimal body weightCardiovascular pathologiesCancersStroke, particularly of unknown aetiology and in young individualsSleep medicineSports medicineImproved individual outcomes under pandemic conditions such as COVID-19.",

        "dc:description": "How do we ensure that future generally intelligent AI share our values? This is the value-alignment problem. It is a weighty matter. After all, if AI are neutral with respect to our wellbeing, or worse, actively hostile toward us, then they pose an existential threat to humanity. Some philosophers have argued that one important way in which we can mitigate this threat is to develop only AI that shares our values or that has values that ‘align with’ ours. However, there is nothing to guarantee that this policy will be universally implemented—in particular, ‘bad actors’ are likely to flout it. In this paper, I show how the predictive processing model of the mind, currently ascendant in cognitive science, may ameliorate the value-alignment problem. In essence, I argue that there are a plurality of reasons why any future generally intelligent AI will possess a predictive processing cognitive architecture (e.g. because we decide to build them that way; because it is the only possible cognitive architecture that can underpin general intelligence; because it is the easiest way to create AI.). I also argue that if future generally intelligent AI possess a predictive processing cognitive architecture, then they will come to share our pro-moral motivations (of valuing humanity as an end; avoiding maleficent actions; etc.), regardless of their initial motivation set. Consequently, these AI will pose a minimal threat to humanity. In this way then, I conclude, the value-alignment problem is significantly ameliorated under the assumption that future generally intelligent AI will possess a predictive processing cognitive architecture.",

        "dc:description": "In this paper, we consider partitioned edge learning (PARTEL), which implements parameter-server training, a well known distributed learning method, in a wireless network. Thereby, PARTEL leverages distributed computation resources at edge devices to train a large-scale artificial intelligence (AI) model by dynamically partitioning the model into parametric blocks for separated updating at devices. Targeting broadband channels, we consider the joint control of parameter allocation, sub-channel allocation, and transmission power to improve the performance of PARTEL. Specifically, the policies for joint SUbcarrier, Parameter, and POweR allocaTion (SUPPORT) are optimized under the criterion of minimum learning latency. Two cases are considered. First, for the case of decomposable models (e.g., logistic regression), the latency-minimization problem is a mixed-integer program and non-convex. Due to its intractability, we develop a practical solution by integer relaxation and transforming it into an equivalent convex problem of model size maximization under a latency constraint. Thereby, a low-complexity algorithm is designed to compute the SUPPORT policy. Second, consider the case of deep neural network (DNN) models which can be trained using PARTEL by introducing some auxiliary variables. This, however, introduces constraints on model partitioning reducing the granularity of parameter allocation. The preceding policy is extended to DNN models by applying the proposed techniques of load rounding and proportional adjustment to rein in latency expansion caused by the load granularity constraints.",

We argue that recent advances in AI for sustainable development, together with the need for a low-carbon recovery from the COVID-19 crisis, open a new window of opportunity for PCAs. Furthermore, we present design principles based on the Sustainable Development Goals for the future adoption of PCAs. We conclude that PCAs could be trialled in selected climate-conscious technologically advanced countries, mindful of potential issues around integration into the current policy mix, privacy concerns and distributional impacts.",

        "dc:description": "River water quality modeling using crucial artificial intelligent (AI) models has become an essential tool for river assessment and management. The simplified approach of river health assessment involves computation of water quality index (WQI). In this study, WQI calculation is based on six water quality variables (i.e., dissolved oxygen in % saturation (DO% sat), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD-Cr), pH, suspended solids (SS), and ammoniacal nitrogen (NH3-N)). This study introduces H2O deep learning (DL), random forest (RF), and decision tree (DT) classification models for WQI based on two investigated modeling scenarios—S-I and S-II. S-I uses a Klang River dataset from five monitoring sites representing a “small-scale catchment”; S-II uses a Klang River Basin dataset from 19 stations representing a “large-scale catchment”. In both scenarios, H2O DL model demonstrated excellent outcome and RF performed rather better in S-I, in terms of model performance accuracy as well as classification error. In S-I/S-II, the accuracy for H2O DL was 88.6%/87.8%, RF 89%/84%, and DT 83%/77%; moreover, in terms of classification error for S-I/S-II, H2O DL 11.3%/12%, RF 10.8%/16%, and DT 14%/22%. H2O DL showed excellent performance when dealing with nonlinear, non-stationary, and varying number of WQ data, and it was followed by the RF model. This study highlights the application of the novel H2O DL and RF models for prediction of river WQI classes. The classification based on WQI for small catchment is simple, fast, cost-effective, and beneficial for river WQ assessment, management, and policy-making. Nonetheless, for a large catchment hydrological dataset, it is yet to be improved using specific function of AI algorithm.",

        "dc:description": "The sixth-generation (6G) of wireless communications systems will significantly rely on fog/edge network architectures for service provisioning. To realize this vision, AI-based fog/edge enabled reinforcement solutions are needed to serve highly stringent applications using dynamically varying resources. In this paper, we propose a cognitive dynamic fog/edge network where primary nodes (PNs) temporarily share their resources and act as fog nodes (FNs) for secondary nodes (SNs). Under this architecture, that unleashes multiple access opportunities, we design distributed fog probing schemes for SNs to search for available connections to access neighbouring FNs. Since the availability of these connections varies in time, we develop strategies to enhance the robustness to the uncertain availability of channels and fog nodes, and reinforce the connections with the FNs. A robustness control optimization is formulated with the aim to maximize the expected total long-term reliability of SNs' transmissions. The problem is solved by an online robustness control (ORC) algorithm that involves online fog probing and an index-based connectivity activation policy derived from restless multi-armed bandits (RMABs) model. Simulation results show that our ORC scheme significantly improves the network robustness, the connectivity reliability and the number of completed transmissions. In addition, by activating the connections with higher indexes, the total long-term reliability optimization problem is solved with low complexity.",

        "dc:description": "The manuscript proposes the innovative energy storage technology which will allow reducing the load from the grid during peak time consumption, as a result, less CO2 will be generated by electrical grid or renewable energy such as wind energy will not be wasted but rather stored in each household. We do not manage the household consumption, but we store the energy whenever it is “greenest“ and can be used in the future and at the same time avoid the usage of the grid during the peak time, thus there is no effect on the dweller lifestyle. Although the technologies used in the article are well known and are ready to use, such a unique combination was never proposed before. We combine photovoltaic arrays, storage heaters and batteries. The inclusion of storage heaters allows us not to use the battery to heat the dwelling and consequently dramatically reduce the battery size needed for the storage. The article also shows the success in avoiding peak times of such combination during numerical simulation test of the control algorithm. These results become exceptionally interesting since this algorithm will be later tested on various pilot sites across North Europe and thus innovate the energy sector.",

        "dc:description": "Edge machine learning involves the deployment of learning algorithms at the network edge to leverage massive distributed data and computation resources to train artificial intelligence (AI) models. Among others, the framework of federated edge learning (FEEL) is popular for its data-privacy preservation. FEEL coordinates global model training at an edge server and local model training at devices that are connected by wireless links. This work contributes to the energy-efficient implementation of FEEL in wireless networks by designing joint computation-and-communication resource management ( C2 RM). The design targets the state-of-the-art heterogeneous mobile architecture where parallel computing using both CPU and GPU, called heterogeneous computing, can significantly improve both the performance and energy efficiency. To minimize the sum energy consumption of devices, we propose a novel C2 RM framework featuring multi-dimensional control including bandwidth allocation, CPU-GPU workload partitioning and speed scaling at each device, and C2 time division for each link. The key component of the framework is a set of equilibriums in energy rates with respect to different control variables that are proved to exist among devices or between processing units at each device. The results are applied to designing efficient algorithms for computing the optimal C2 RM policies faster than the standard optimization tools. Based on the equilibriums, we further design energy-efficient schemes for device scheduling and greedy spectrum sharing that scavenges 'spectrum holes' resulting from heterogeneous C2 time divisions among devices. Using a real dataset, experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of C2 RM on improving the energy efficiency of a FEEL system.",

        "dc:description": "Anticipating the ethical impact of emerging technologies is an essential part of responsible innovation. One such emergent technology is the digital twin which we define here as a living replica of a physical system (human or non-human). A digital twin combines various emerging technologies such as AI, Internet of Things, big data and robotics, each component bringing its own socio-ethical issues to the resulting artefacts. The question thus arises which of these socio-ethical themes surface in the process and how they are perceived by stakeholders in the field. In this report we present the results of a qualitative study into the socio-ethical benefits and socio-ethical risks of using digital twins in healthcare. Employing insights from ethics of technology and the Quadruple Helix theory of innovation, we conducted desk research of white literature and 23 interviews with representatives from the four helixes: industry, research, policy and civil society. The ethical scan revealed several important areas where the digital twin can produce socio-ethical value (e.g., prevention and treatment of disease, cost reduction, patient autonomy and freedom, equal treatment) but also several important areas of socio-ethical risks (e.g., privacy and property of data, disruption of existing societal structures, inequality and injustice). We conclude with a reflection on the employed analytical tool and suggestions for further research.",

        "dc:description": "Through appropriate operations and policies, such as green processes and product development process (PDP), companies can respond to environmental sustainability. To remain competitive, one such approach, Design for X (DFX), involves considering different environment and sustainable strategies through different factors Xs. With regard to the availability of different DFX techniques that consider environmental issues, the decision as to which approach needs to be adopted remains absent. This paper aims at presenting an overview from 1980 to 2020 of the developed research, applications, and DFX techniques for assessing green issues. Selected DFX techniques are linked with strategies used in organizations. Following a literature analysis, a collaborative knowledge-based framework that addresses the design concepts needed to assess environmental, safety, and health concerns in the development of green products is proposed. Furthermore, as a pillar for considering the Semantic Web and an evolving approach linked with natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI), an ontology-based knowledge management model for green assessment is developed for the representation, acquisition, organization, and capitalization of knowledge in a computer interpretable manner. The findings are useful for both managers and practitioners as they provide a coherent domain ontology that can help them manage knowledge, improve teamwork, and make decisions in a collaborative green PDP. Besides, an understanding of the essential design considerations that are required to implement environmental, safety, and health issues, as well as competencies used in the PDP is presented. Key barriers, managerial and strategic implications, and mitigation actions are also identified in this paper.",

        "dc:description": "The pandemic COVID 19 has altered individuals’ daily lives across the globe. It has led to preventive measures such as physical distancing to be imposed on individuals and led to terms such as ‘lockdown,’ ‘emergency,’ or curfew’ to emerge in various countries. It has affected society, not only physically and financially, but in terms of emotional wellbeing as well. This distress in the human emotional quotient results from multiple factors such as financial implications, family member’s behavior and support, country-specific lockdown protocols, media influence, or fear of the pandemic. For efficient pandemic management, there is a need to understand the emotional variations among individuals, as this will provide insights into public sentiment towards various government pandemic management policies. From our investigations, it was found that individuals have increasingly used different microblogging platforms such as Twitter to remain connected and express their feelings and concerns during the pandemic. However, research in the area of expressed emotional wellbeing during COVID 19 is still growing, which motivated this team to form the aim: To identify, explore and understand globally the emotions expressed during the earlier months of the pandemic COVID 19 by utilizing Deep Learning and Natural language Processing (NLP). For the data collection, over 2 million tweets during February–June 2020 were collected and analyzed using an advanced deep learning technique of Transfer Learning and Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach (RoBERTa). A Reddit-based standard Emotion Dataset by Crowdflower was utilized for transfer learning. Using RoBERTa and the collated Twitter dataset, a multi-class emotion classifier system was formed. With the implemented methodology, a tweet classification accuracy of 80.33% and an average MCC score of 0.78 was achieved, improving the existing AI-based emotion classification methods. This study explains the novel application of the Roberta model during the pandemic that provided insights into changing emotional wellbeing over time of various citizens worldwide. It also offers novelty for data mining and analytics during this challenging, pandemic era. These insights can be beneficial for formulating effective pandemic management strategies and devising a novel, predictive strategy for the emotional well-being of an entire country’s citizens when facing future unexpected exogenous shocks.",

        "dc:description": "Artificial intelligence (AI) represents a valuable tool that could be widely used to inform clinical and public health decision-making to effectively manage the impacts of a pandemic. The objective of this scoping review was to identify the key use cases for involving AI for pandemic preparedness and response from the peer-reviewed, preprint, and grey literature. The data synthesis had two parts: an in-depth review of studies that leveraged machine learning (ML) techniques and a limited review of studies that applied traditional modeling approaches. ML applications from the in-depth review were categorized into use cases related to public health and clinical practice, and narratively synthesized. One hundred eighty-three articles met the inclusion criteria for the in-depth review. Six key use cases were identified: forecasting infectious disease dynamics and effects of interventions; surveillance and outbreak detection; real-time monitoring of adherence to public health recommendations; real-time detection of influenza-like illness; triage and timely diagnosis of infections; and prognosis of illness and response to treatment. Data sources and types of ML that were useful varied by use case. The search identified 1167 articles that reported on traditional modeling approaches, which highlighted additional areas where ML could be leveraged for improving the accuracy of estimations or projections. Important ML-based solutions have been developed in response to pandemics, and particularly for COVID-19 but few were optimized for practical application early in the pandemic. These findings can support policymakers, clinicians, and other stakeholders in prioritizing research and development to support operationalization of AI for future pandemics.",

        "dc:description": "People rely on data-driven AI technologies nearly every time they go online, whether they are shopping, scrolling through news feeds, or looking for entertainment. Yet despite their ubiquity, personalization algorithms and the associated large-scale collection of personal data have largely escaped public scrutiny. Policy makers who wish to introduce regulations that respect people’s attitudes towards privacy and algorithmic personalization on the Internet would greatly benefit from knowing how people perceive personalization and personal data collection. To contribute to an empirical foundation for this knowledge, we surveyed public attitudes towards key aspects of algorithmic personalization and people’s data privacy concerns and behavior using representative online samples in Germany (N = 1065), Great Britain (N = 1092), and the United States (N = 1059). Our findings show that people object to the collection and use of sensitive personal information and to the personalization of political campaigning and, in Germany and Great Britain, to the personalization of news sources. Encouragingly, attitudes are independent of political preferences: People across the political spectrum share the same concerns about their data privacy and show similar levels of acceptance regarding personalized digital services and the use of private data for personalization. We also found an acceptability gap: People are more accepting of personalized services than of the collection of personal data and information required for these services. A large majority of respondents rated, on average, personalized services as more acceptable than the collection of personal information or data. The acceptability gap can be observed at both the aggregate and the individual level. Across countries, between 64% and 75% of respondents showed an acceptability gap. Our findings suggest a need for transparent algorithmic personalization that minimizes use of personal data, respects people’s preferences on personalization, is easy to adjust, and does not extend to political advertising.",

We use the AIOE to construct a measure of AI exposure at the industry level, which we call the AI Industry Exposure (AIIE) and a measure of AI exposure at the county level, which we call the AI Geographic Exposure (AIGE). We also describe several ways in which the AIOE can be used to create firm level measures of AI exposure. We validate the measures and describe how they can be used in different applications by management, organization and strategy scholars. Managerial Summary: Although artificial intelligence (AI) promises to spur economic growth, there is widespread concern that it could displace workers, alter industry trajectories, and reshape organizations. Despite the interest in this area, we have limited ability to study the effects of AI on occupations, firms, industries, and geographies because of limited availability of data that measures exposure to AI. To address this limitation, we create and validate a new measure of an occupation's exposure to AI that we call the AI Occupational Exposure (AIOE). We use the AIOE to construct a measure of AI exposure at the industry level (AIIE) and county level (AIGE). We describe how our measures can be useful to scholars and policy-makers interested in identifying the effect of AI on markets.",

        "dc:description": "This study considered and developed four artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to estimate mining capital cost (MCC) for open-pit copper mining projects with high accuracy, including artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and classification and regression tree (CART); 74 observations of mining projects were collected and analyzed to predict MCC based on five input variables. Root-mean-squared error (RMSE), coefficient of correlation (R2), mean absolute error (MAE), and absolute percentage error (APE), were used to evaluate the performance/quality/accuracy of the models. The results of this study indicated that ANN, RF, SVM and CART models were advanced techniques in predicting MCC with high accuracy. Of those, the ANN model yielded the most dominant accuracy/performance with an RMSE of 138.103, R2 of 0.990, MAE of 114.589, and APE of 7.770%. The remaining models (i.e. RF, SVM, CART) yielded lower performance with RMSE in the range of 172.975–379.691, R2 in the range of 0.924–0.987, MAE in the range of 134.982–301.196, and APE in the range of 10.339%–19.384%. The results of the sensitivity analysis of this work also revealed that production capacity includes MineAP and MillAP, were the two most essential parameters on the MCC predictive models. They should be used as the primary input parameters for estimating MCC in actual.",

        "dc:description": "Urban development has a great impact on water bodies in many aspects, especially for cities rich in water resources. Thus, it is urgent to carry out relevant monitoring and research. This study takes Wuhan as study area. Based on relevant studies at home and abroad, as well as Wuhan water protection policies, this study put forward a technical route, integrating water area, water quality, water landscape, and waterfront ecology, to reflect the spatiotemporal characteristics of urban scale water more comprehensively. Specifically, the random forest model was used to obtain water information of 67 key water bodies from remote sensing images from 1979 to 2019. Based on the information, the changes of water area and water landscape were analyzed. The evolution characteristics of water quality and waterfront ecology were analyzed based on water quality monitoring data and Remote Sensing Ecological Index (RSEI), respectively. Then, the influencing factors of the changes in water body area were analyzed using the Multi-scale Geographical Weighted Regression model (MGWR). This study aims to provide scientific support for the government to formulate differentiated water protection policies, and provide useful reference for the multi-factor analysis of water bodies in other regions. The results showed that the total water areas of Wuhan and 67 key water bodies had decreased by 10.75% and 13.12%, respectively. There were significant differences in the changes of water bodies in the downtown area and the suburban area. The water landscape showed a degradation trend. The Perimeter Area Fractal Dimension (PAFRAC), Edge Density(ED), Mean Patch Area(MPA), Aggregation Index(AI), and Cohesion Index (COHESION) decreased by 6.43%, 79.35%, 1.55%, and 10.94%, respectively. The water quality of Wuhan was deteriorating. Most of the rivers and reservoirs are of class III or above all the year round. Most of the lakes in the downtown area are of class V or below. Most of the lakes in the suburbs are of class IV or V. Changes of RSEI of the waterfront in the downtown area and the suburb area showed that the eco-environment of the waterfront zone was recovering. The average RSEI of waterfront in the downtown area had increased by 14.29%. MGWR analysis showed that among the natural factors, the increase of relative humidity had more effects on the recovery of lakes in Jiangxia, while the increase of precipitation had a more significant impact on the recovery of lakes with smaller water area. Among the socioeconomic factors, the increase of GDP in each administrative region was helpful to water restoration, especially for water bodies in the downtown area, Huangpi, and Xinzhou. The increase of Impervious Surface (IS) proportion in waterfront area had led to the shrinkage of most water bodies. For a few key recovering water bodies, the growth of IS due to relevant protection policies had a positive effect on the recovery of these bodies.",

        "dc:description": "Cognitive radio network (CRN) is a promising technology that mitigates the scarcity of spectrum. The main challenge faced in the opportunistic CRN is the spectrum sensing (SS). The traditional methods of SS use detectors to find the available bands, which appear to provide unreliable performance in the case of actual environment where noise is predominant. Literature has proved that employing an artificial intelligence (AI) model for routing overcomes the lack of network knowledge and lack of human intervention and helps to learn robust patterns. Reinforced learning (RL) is a dynamically learning process that selects the actions based on continuous feedback received from the dynamic environment to maximize the reward. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) models have proven to be successful at learning control policies image inputs. However, they struggle with learning policies that require longer term information. Recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures have been used in tasks dealing with longer term dependencies between data points. Motivated by the performance of AI models, these architectures are investigated in this work to overcome the difficulties arising from learning policies with long-term dependencies. Thus, a deep recurrent reinforced learning-based Q-routing (DRRL-based Q-routing) is developed. The proposed study suggests a multihop CRN operated in an interweave mode. This algorithm finds optimal routing path between the secondary user transmitter (SUT) and the secondary user destination (SUD), optimal SS duration, and individual secondary user (SU) power requirements for SS and data transmission process while minimizing the end-to-end outage under the constraints of energy causality, SS reliability, interference threshold, and individual link throughput.",

Twenty-four meat preparations were examined: fresh sausages, cévapčicí, pljeskavica and hamburger. Gas chromatography of FA and TFA was used. Trans fat was higher than the recommended value of 0.5% in cévapčicí, pljeskavica and hamburger (0.54-0.62%) and lower in fresh sausages (0.26%). There were significant differences (P < 0.05) in the atherogenicity index (AI), which was lower in fresh sausages (0.58) and cévapčicí (0.64) and pljeskavica (0.64) and highest in hamburger (0.77). Concerning thrombogenicity indices (TI), there was a significant difference (P < 0.05), being the lowest in fresh sausages (1.42), cévapčicí (1.28) and pljeskavica (1.40) and the highest in hamburger (1.82). AI and TI of traditional meat preparations were higher than recommended indices, 0.5 and 1.0, respectively, and so are not desirable for health protection. The n-6/n-3 ratio was significantly (P < 0.05) lower in pljeskavica (10.76) and hamburger (7.30) compared with cévapčicí (22.25) and fresh sausages (28.41).

        "dc:description": "While machine learning techniques have been transformative in solving a range of problems, an important challenge is to understand why they arrive at the decisions they output. Some have argued that this necessitates augmenting machine intelligence with understanding such that, when queried, a machine is able to explain its behaviour (i.e., explainable AI). In this article, we address the issue of machine understanding from the perspective of active inference. This paradigm enables decision making based upon a model of how data are generated. The generative model contains those variables required to explain sensory data, and its inversion may be seen as an attempt to explain the causes of these data. Here we are interested in explanations of one’s own actions. This implies a deep generative model that includes a model of the world, used to infer policies, and a higher-level model that attempts to predict which policies will be selected based upon a space of hypothetical (i.e., counterfactual) explanations—and which can subsequently be used to provide (retrospective) explanations about the policies pursued. We illustrate the construct validity of this notion of understanding in relation to human understanding by highlighting the similarities in computational architecture and the consequences of its dysfunction.",

        "dc:description": "With the increasingly serious employment situation in China, the government and schools encourage college students to start businesses to alleviate employment pressure. College student's successful entrepreneurship depends on national preferential policies, social support, and, most importantly, their healthy and solid psychological quality and entrepreneurial psychological quality. The purpose is to understand the entrepreneurial psychology of college students and study the entrepreneurial psychological effect. Firstly, the four aspects of entrepreneurial psychology are summarized, including entrepreneurial awareness, entrepreneurial volition, entrepreneurial ability, and entrepreneurial personality. Secondly, the research status of college students' entrepreneurial psychology is reviewed, and the existing problems are pointed out. Thirdly, the combined model of wavelet transform and Neural Network (NN) is proposed, and the feasibility of the proposed model is evaluated through the analysis of college students' entrepreneurial psychology. The wavelet NN is used in experimental design to predict college students' entrepreneurial psychology, and the predicted results are compared with the actual value. From the perspective of the prediction results of entrepreneurial psychology, the combination of wavelet algorithm and neural network is more accurate for entrepreneurial psychology prediction and evaluation results of law students. Overall, the difference between the predicted value and the actual value is within 0.3 points, which is relatively stable. According to the analysis of single-factor results, the scores of students of different majors in the four dimensions of entrepreneurial psychology are all higher than 3.5, but there is no significant difference among the four dimensions (P > 0.05), indicating that the major has no significant impact on entrepreneurial psychology; law students with different educational backgrounds have significant differences in entrepreneurial psychology (P < 0.05), among which students with a master's degree have the strongest entrepreneurial will, while doctoral students have the lowest entrepreneurial will; in terms of entrepreneurial psychological capital, men's self-efficacy is higher than women's, and the difference is significant (P < 0.05). The difference between males and females in the scores of entrepreneurial psychological factors' four aspects is not very obvious. In terms of entrepreneurial psychological capital, males' self-efficacy is significantly higher than females' (P < 0.05). Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology has great application prospects in the prediction and evaluation of college students' entrepreneurial psychology, and college students' entrepreneurial psychology is highly correlated with gender and education.",

        "dc:description": "The 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic revealed the urgent need for the acceleration of vaccine development worldwide. Rapid vaccine development poses numerous risks for each category of vaccine technology. By using the Risklick artificial intelligence (AI), we estimated the risks associated with all types of COVID-19 vaccine during the early phase of vaccine development. We then performed a postmortem analysis of the probability and the impact matrix calculations by comparing the 2020 prognosis to the contemporary situation. We used the Risklick AI to evaluate the risks and their incidence associated with vaccine development in the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our analysis revealed the diversity of risks among vaccine technologies currently used by pharmaceutical companies providing vaccines. This analysis highlighted the current and future potential pitfalls connected to vaccine production during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, the Risklick AI appears as an essential tool in vaccine development for the treatment of COVID-19 in order to formally anticipate the risks, and increases the overall performance from the production to the distribution of the vaccines. The Risklick AI could, therefore, be extended to other fields of research and development and represent a novel opportunity in the calculation of production-associated risks.",

Especially during the coronavirus disease (COVID‑19) pandemic, AI has played a key role in response to the global health crisis. There has been a boom in AI innovation and its use since the pandemic. However, despite its widespread adoption and great potential, most people have little knowledge of AI concepts and realization of its potential. The objective of this white paper is to communicate the importance of AI and its benefits to society. The report covers AI applications in six different topics from medicine (AI deployment in clinical settings, imaging and diagnostics, and acceleration of drug discovery) to more social aspects (support older adults in long‑term care homes, and AI in supporting small and medium enterprises. The report ends with nine steps to consider for moving forward with AI implementation during and post pandemic period. These include legal and ethical data collection and storage, greater data access, multidisciplinary collaboration, and policy reform.",

        "dc:description": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved over the last few years; its use in DR screening has been demonstrated in multiple evidences across the globe. However, there are concerns right from the data acquisition, bias in data, difficulty in comparing between different algorithm, challenges in machine learning, its application in different group of population, and human barrier to AI adoption in health care. There are also legal and ethical concerns related to AI. The tension between risks and concerns on one hand versus potential and opportunity on the other have driven a need for authorities to implement policies for AI in DR screening to address these issues. The policy makers should support and facilitate research and development of AI in healthcare, but at the same time, it has to be ensured that the use of AI in healthcare aligns with recognized standards of safety, efficacy, and equity. It is essential to ensure that algorithms, datasets, and decisions are auditable and when applied to medical care (such as screening, diagnosis, or treatment) are clinically validated and explainable. Policy frameworks should require design of AI systems in health care that are informed by real-world workflow and human-centric design. Lastly, it should be ensured that healthcare AI solutions align with all relevant ethical obligations, from design to development to use and to be delivered properly in the real world.",

        "dc:description": "Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) holds the promise of supporting nurses’ clinical decision-making in complex care situations or conducting tasks that are remote from direct patient interaction, such as documentation processes. There has been an increase in the research and development of AI applications for nursing care, but there is a persistent lack of an extensive overview covering the evidence base for promising application scenarios. Objective: This study synthesizes literature on application scenarios for AI in nursing care settings as well as highlights adjacent aspects in the ethical, legal, and social discourse surrounding the application of AI in nursing care. Methods: Following a rapid review design, PubMed, CINAHL, Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Xplore, Digital Bibliography & Library Project, and Association for Information Systems Library, as well as the libraries of leading AI conferences, were searched in June 2020. Publications of original quantitative and qualitative research, systematic reviews, discussion papers, and essays on the ethical, legal, and social implications published in English were included. Eligible studies were analyzed on the basis of predetermined selection criteria. Results: The titles and abstracts of 7016 publications and 704 full texts were screened, and 292 publications were included. Hospitals were the most prominent study setting, followed by independent living at home; fewer application scenarios were identified for nursing homes or home care. Most studies used machine learning algorithms, whereas expert or hybrid systems were entailed in less than every 10th publication. The application context of focusing on image and signal processing with tracking, monitoring, or the classification of activity and health followed by care coordination and communication, as well as fall detection, was the main purpose of AI applications. Few studies have reported the effects of AI applications on clinical or organizational outcomes, lacking particularly in data gathered outside laboratory conditions. In addition to technological requirements, the reporting and inclusion of certain requirements capture more overarching topics, such as data privacy, safety, and technology acceptance. Ethical, legal, and social implications reflect the discourse on technology use in health care but have mostly not been discussed in meaningful and potentially encompassing detail. Conclusions: The results highlight the potential for the application of AI systems in different nursing care settings. Considering the lack of findings on the effectiveness and application of AI systems in real-world scenarios, future research should reflect on a more nursing care–specific perspective toward objectives, outcomes, and benefits. We identify that, crucially, an advancement in technological-societal discourse that surrounds the ethical and legal implications of AI applications in nursing care is a necessary next step. Further, we outline the need for greater participation among all of the stakeholders involved.",

        "dc:description": "Rapid increase in conversational AI and user chat data lead to intensive development of dialogue management systems (DMS) for various industries. Yet, for low-resource languages, such as Azerbaijani, very little research has been conducted. The main purpose of this work is to experiment with various DMS pipeline set-ups to decide on the most appropriate natural language understanding and dialogue manager settings. In our project, we designed and evaluated different DMS pipelines with respect to the conversational text data obtained from one of the leading retail banks in Azerbaijan. In the work, the main two components of DMS—Natural language Understanding (NLU) and Dialogue Manager—have been investigated. In the first step of NLU, we utilized a language identification (LI) component for language detection. We investigated both built-in LI methods such as fastText and custom machine learning (ML) models trained on the domain-based dataset. The second step of the work was a comparison of the classic ML classifiers (logistic regression, neural networks, and SVM) and Dual Intent and Entity Transformer (DIET) architecture for user intention detection. In these experiments we used different combinations of feature extractors such as CountVectorizer, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) Vectorizer, and word embeddings for both word and character n-gram based tokens. To extract important information from the text messages, Named Entity Extraction (NER) component was added to the pipeline. The best NER model was chosen among conditional random fields (CRF) tagger, deep neural networks (DNN), models and build in entity extraction component inside DIET architecture. Obtained entity tags fed to the Dialogue Management module as features. All NLU set-ups were followed by the Dialogue Management module that contains a Rule-based Policy to handle FAQs and chitchats as well as a Transformer Embedding Dialogue (TED) Policy to handle more complex and unexpected dialogue inputs. As a result, we suggest a DMS pipeline for a financial assistant, which is capable of identifying intentions, named entities, and a language of text followed by policies that allow generating a proper response (based on the designed dialogues) and suggesting the best next action.",

        "dc:description": "The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact people worldwide–steadily depleting scarce resources in healthcare. Medical Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises a much-needed relief but only if the technology gets adopted at scale. The present research investigates people’s intention to adopt medical AI as well as the drivers of this adoption in a representative study of two European countries (Denmark and France, N = 1068) during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results reveal AI aversion; only 1 of 10 individuals choose medical AI over human physicians in a hypothetical triage-phase of COVID-19 pre-hospital entrance. Key predictors of medical AI adoption are people’s trust in medical AI and, to a lesser extent, the trait of open-mindedness. More importantly, our results reveal that mistrust and perceived uniqueness neglect from human physicians, as well as a lack of social belonging significantly increase people’s medical AI adoption. These results suggest that for medical AI to be widely adopted, people may need to express less confidence in human physicians and to even feel disconnected from humanity. We discuss the social implications of these findings and propose that successful medical AI adoption policy should focus on trust building measures–without eroding trust in human physicians.",

        "dc:description": "Background: Artificial Intelligence (AI) platforms, increasingly deployed in public health, utilize robust data systems as a critical component for health emergency preparedness. Yet, Africa faces numerous challenges in the availability, analyses, and use of data to inform health decision-making. Countries have limited access to their population data. Those with access, struggle to utilize these data for program improvements. Owing to the rapid growth of mobile phone ownership and use in the region, Africa is poised to leverage AI technologies to increase the adoption, access and use of data for health. To discuss and propose solutions for responsible development and adoption of innovations like AI in Africa, a virtual workshop was organized from the 21st to 24th June, 2021. This report highlights critical policy dimensions of strengthening digital health ecosystems by high-level policymakers, technical experts, academia, public and private sector partners. Method: The four days’ workshop focused on nine sessions, with each session focusing on three themes. Discussions during the sessions concentrated on public and private sectors, the academia and multilateral organizations’ deployment of AI. These discussions expanded participants’ understanding of AI, the opportunities and challenges that exist during adoption, including the future of AI for health in the African region. Approximately 250 participants attended the workshop, including countries representatives from ministries of Health, Information and Technology, Developmental Organizations, Private Sector, Academia and Research Institutions among others. Results: The workshop resolved that governments and relevant stakeholders should collaborate to ensure that AI and digital health receive critical attention. Government ownership and leadership were identified as critical for sustainable financing and effective scale-up of AI-enabled applications in Africa. Thus, government is to ensure that key recommendations from the workshop are implemented to improve health sector development in Africa. Conclusions: The AI workshop was a good forum to deliberate important issues regarding AI for health in the African context. It was concluded that there is a need to focus on vital priorities in deploying AI in Africa: Data protection, privacy and sharing protocols; training and creating platforms for researchers; funding and business models; developing frameworks for assessing and implementing AI; organizing forums and conferences on AI; and instituting regulations, governance and ethical guidelines for AI. There is a need to adopt a health systems approach in planning for AI to reduce inefficiencies, redundancies while increasing effectiveness in the use of AI. Thus, robust collaborations and partnerships among governments and various stakeholders were identified as key.",

        "dc:description": "The continuous urbanisation in most Low-to-Middle-Income-Country (LMIC) cities is accompanied by rapid socio-economic changes in urban and peri-urban areas. Urban transformation processes, such as gentrification as well as the increase in poor urban neighbourhoods (e.g., slums) produce new urban patterns. The intersection of very rapid socio-economic and demographic dynamics are often insufficiently understood, and relevant data for understanding them are commonly unavailable, dated, or too coarse (resolution). Traditional survey-based methods (e.g., census) are carried out at low temporal granularity and do not allow for frequent updates of large urban areas. Researchers and policymakers typically work with very dated data, which do not reflect on-the-ground realities and data aggregation hide socio-economic disparities. Therefore, the potential of Earth Observations (EO) needs to be unlocked. EO data have the ability to provide information at detailed spatial and temporal scales so as to support monitoring transformations. In this paper, we showcase how recent innovations in EO and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can provide relevant, rapid information about socio-economic conditions, and in particular on poor urban neighbourhoods, when large scale and/or multi-temporal data are required, e.g., to support Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) monitoring. We provide solutions to key challenges, including the provision of multi-scale data, the reduction in data costs, and the mapping of socio-economic conditions. These innovations fill data gaps for the production of statistical information, addressing the problems of access to field-based data under COVID-19.",

        "dc:description": "Rural areas in southern China receive ample rainfall annually as well as over 1600 h of annual sunshine. Despite a generally severe urban–rural development imbalance, these rural areas feature well‐developed basic infrastructure and diverse economic activities. Rural revitalization policies in these areas have emphasized the development of cultural and ecological tourism, which has spurred economic development and given rise to a trend of villa construction. Residential buildings sit on large areas where natural resources are abundant. These advantages are conducive to the development and use of sustainable resources. This study proposes an incentive policy encouraging rural residents to renovate their buildings to include rainwater conservation and solar power generation. The Delphi method, an analytic hierarchy process, and fuzzy logic theory were combined to establish an AI‐MCDM model, with applications of artificial intelligence and multiple‐criteria decision making. Using Conghua District, Guangdong Province as an example, the study suggested that the model is beneficial to increasing the willingness of rural residents to reconstruct and renovate their residences, promoting the development of a low‐carbon ecological region, Wenquan Township. We conducted the Delphi process twice to assess and validate incentives for installing natural resource conservation structures in agricultural areas. Nine criteria were identified, which can be divided into three main dimensions of participation situation, generating capacity, and storage facilities. The proposed AI‐MCDM model developed using the Delphi–Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process Model has high objectivity and can support rural areas in developing low‐carbon, sustainable characteristics. The findings can serve as a reference for governments formulating incentives to encourage the installation of rainwater conservation and solar energy generation structures by rural households.",

        "dc:description": "Recent advances in autonomy of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have increased their use in remote sensing applications, such as precision agriculture, biosecurity, disaster monitoring, and surveillance. However, onboard UAV cognition capabilities for understanding and interacting in environments with imprecise or partial observations, for objects of interest within complex scenes, are limited, and have not yet been fully investigated. This limitation of onboard decision-making under uncertainty has delegated the motion planning strategy in complex environments to human pilots, which rely on communication subsystems and real-time telemetry from ground control stations. This paper presents a UAV-based autonomous motion planning and object finding system under uncertainty and partial observability in outdoor environments. The proposed system architecture follows a modular design, which allocates most of the computationally intensive tasks to a companion computer onboard the UAV to achieve high-fidelity results in simulated environments. We demonstrate the system with a search and rescue (SAR) case study, where a lost person (victim) in bushland needs to be found using a sub-2 kg quadrotor UAV. The navigation problem is mathematically formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). A motion strategy (or policy) is obtained once a POMDP is solved mid-flight and in real time using augmented belief trees (ABT) and the TAPIR toolkit. The system’s performance was assessed using three flight modes: (1) mission mode, which follows a survey plan and used here as the baseline motion planner; (2) offboard mode, which runs the POMDP-based planner across the flying area; and (3) hybrid mode, which combines mission and offboard modes for improved coverage in outdoor scenarios. Results suggest the increased cognitive power added by the proposed motion planner and flight modes allow UAVs to collect more accurate victim coordinates compared to the baseline planner. Adding the proposed system to UAVs results in improved robustness against potential false positive readings of detected objects caused by data noise, inaccurate detections, and elevated complexity to navigate in time-critical applications, such as SAR.",

        "dc:description": "In many developed countries, the usage of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has become important in paving the future path in how data is managed and secured in the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) sector. SMEs in these developed countries have created their own cyber regimes around AI and ML. This knowledge is tested daily in how these countries’ SMEs run their businesses and identify threats and attacks, based on the support structure of the individual country. Based on recent changes to the UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Brexit, and ISO standards requirements, machine learning cybersecurity (MLCS) adoption in the UK SME market has become prevalent and a good example to lean on, amongst other developed nations. Whilst MLCS has been successfully applied in many applications, including network intrusion detection systems (NIDs) worldwide, there is still a gap in the rate of adoption of MLCS techniques for UK SMEs. Other developed countries such as Spain and Australia also fall into this category, and similarities and differences to MLCS adoptions are discussed. Applications of how MLCS is applied within these SME industries are also explored. The paper investigates, using quantitative and qualitative methods, the challenges to adopting MLCS in the SME ecosystem, and how operations are managed to promote business growth. Much like security guards and policing in the real world, the virtual world is now calling on MLCS techniques to be embedded like secret service covert operations to protect data being distributed by the millions into cyberspace. This paper will use existing global research from multiple disciplines to identify gaps and opportunities for UK SME small business cyber security. This paper will also highlight barriers and reasons for low adoption rates of MLCS in SMEs and compare success stories of larger companies implementing MLCS. The methodology uses structured quantitative and qualitative survey questionnaires, distributed across an extensive participation pool directed to the SMEs’ management and technical and non-technical professionals using stratify methods. Based on the analysis and findings, this study reveals that from the primary data obtained, SMEs have the appropriate cybersecurity packages in place but are not fully aware of their potential. Secondary data collection was run in parallel to better understand how these barriers and challenges emerged, and why the rate of adoption of MLCS was very low. The paper draws the conclusion that help through government policies and processes coupled together with collaboration could minimize cyber threats in combatting hackers and malicious actors in trying to stay ahead of the game. These aspirations can be reached by ensuring that those involved have been well trained and understand the importance of communication when applying appropriate safety processes and procedures. This paper also highlights important funding gaps that could help raise cyber security awareness in the form of grants, subsidies, and financial assistance through various public sector policies and training. Lastly, SMEs’ lack of understanding of risks and impacts of cybercrime could lead to conflicting messages between cross-company IT and cybersecurity rules. Trying to find the right balance between this risk and impact, versus productivity impact and costs, could lead to UK SMES getting over these hurdles in this cyberspace in the quest for promoting the usage of MLCS. UK and Wales governments can use the research conducted in this paper to inform and adapt their policies to help UK SMEs become more secure from cyber-attacks and compare them to other developed countries also on the same future path.",

Impervious surface, a typical artificial construction can be used to reflect urban development. Therefore, this study estimated the spatiotemporal dynamics and expansion patterns of impervious surface area (ISA) in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau (GHM) Bay Area since the establishment of the “Pearl River Delta economic zone” in 1994. Landsat time-series images were used to map the distribution of the ISA based on the combinational biophysical composition index (CBCI) and the bidirectional temporal filtering method (BTFM). The results indicated that the ISA in the GHM Bay Area drastically expanded from 569.23 km2 in 1994 to 10,200.53 km2 in 2016. In addition, the aggregation index (AI) value of the high-density area showed a decreasing trend from 1994 to 2004. However, the value of each landscape metric rapidly increased after 2004. Moreover, the mean ratio of the major axis to the minor axis of standard deviational ellipses from 1994 to 2004 was higher than that from 2005 to 2016. The results of landscape metrics and standard deviational ellipses indicated that the ISA growth pattern changed from edge expanding and leapfrogging to infilling and consolidation, with a turning point in 2004. Moreover, the principal sprawl orientation of the ISA was northwest to southeast before 2004. After 2004, the expansion direction of the ISA was less obvious due to the development pattern of infilling and consolidation. The rapid increase of GDP and population are the driving forces of urban expansion. However, topography and ecological protection policies as the limiting factors, which caused the infilling of the inner city and redevelopment of old urban areas.",

        "dc:description": "Autonomous driving has attracted great attention from both academics and industries. To realise autonomous driving, Deep Imitation Learning (DIL) is treated as one of the most promising solutions, because it improves autonomous driving systems by automatically learning a complex mapping from human driving data, compared to manually designing the driving policy. However, existing DIL methods cannot generalise well across domains, that is, a network trained on the data of source domain gives rise to poor generalisation on the data of target domain. In the present study, we propose a novel brain-inspired deep imitation method that builds on the evidence from human brain functions, to improve the generalisation ability of DNN so that autonomous driving systems can perform well in various scenarios. Specifically, humans have a strong generalisation ability which is beneficial from the structural and functional asymmetry of the two sides of the brain. Here, we design dual Neural Circuit Policy (NCP) architectures in DNN based on the asymmetry of human neural networks. Experimental results demonstrate that our brain-inspired method outperforms existing methods regarding generalisation when dealing with unseen data. Our source codes and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/Intenzo21/Brain-Inspired-Deep-Imitation-Learning-for-Autonomous-Driving-Systems.",

        "dc:description": "The potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and its manifold applications have fueled the discussion around how AI can be used to facilitate sustainable objectives. However, the technical, ethical, and legal literature on how AI, including its design, training, implementation, and use can be sustainable, is rather limited. At the same time, consumers incrementally pay more attention to sustainability information, whereas businesses are increasingly engaging in greenwashing practices, especially in relation to digital products and services, raising concerns about the efficiency of the existing consumer protection framework in this regard. The objective of this paper is to contribute to the discussion toward sustainable AI from a legal and consumer protection standpoint while focusing on the environmental and societal pillar of sustainability. After analyzing the multidisciplinary literature available on the topic of the environmentally sustainable AI lifecycle, as well as the latest EU policies and initiatives regarding consumer protection and sustainability, we will examine whether the current consumer protection framework is sufficient to promote sharing and substantiation of sustainability information in B2C contracts involving AI products and services. Moreover, we will assess whether AI-related AI initiatives can promote a sustainable AI development. Finally, we will propose a set of recommendations capable of encouraging a sustainable and environmentally-conscious AI lifecycle while enhancing information transparency among stakeholders, aligning the various EU policies and initiatives, and ultimately empowering consumers.",

In order to measure economic, social and financial benefits deriving from 5G networks and digital transformation, a piloted technology model has been shaped with the final aim of designing new models of port management and operational planning, and of implementing sustainable port growth policies. Such an assessment finally represents a crucial means to enhance technological advancements on port competitiveness and efficiency, and to boost sustainability performance by supporting public policies and business decisions, finally leading to the development of the port of the future.",

        "dc:description": "The progress of Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) research in school buildings has increased profusely in the last two decades and the interest in this area is still growing worldwide. IEQ in classrooms impacts the comfort, health, and productivity of students as well as teachers. This article systematically discusses IEQ parameters related to studies conducted in Indian school classrooms during the last fifteen years. Real-time research studies conducted on Indoor Air Quality (IAQ), Thermal Comfort (TC), Acoustic Comfort (AcC), and Visual Comfort (VC) in Indian school classrooms from July 2006 to March 2021 are considered to gain insight into the existing research methodologies. This review article indicates that IEQ parameter studies in Indian school buildings are tortuous, strewn, inadequate, and unorganized. There is no literature review available on studies conducted on IEQ parameters in Indian school classrooms. The results infer that in India, there is no well-established method to assess the indoor environmental condition of classrooms in school buildings to date. Indian school classrooms are bleak and in dire need of energy-efficient modifications that maintain good IEQ for better teaching and learning outcomes. The prevailing COVID-19 Pandemic, Artificial Intelligence (AI), National Education Policy (NEP), Sick Building Syndrome (SBS), Internet of Things (IoT), and Green Schools (GS) are also discussed to effectively link existing conditions with the future of IEQ research in Indian school classrooms.",

The chronically underfunded Indian Health Service (IHS) is just one example where AI/AN children are not universally guaranteed equitable health care or opportunity to thrive. Poverty is highly predictive of educational achievement, employment opportunities, violence, and ultimately health outcomes. COVID-19 has not only exacerbated physical and mental health inequities experienced by AI/AN communities, but has also intensified the economic consequences of inequity. Thus, it is vital to advocate for programs and policies that are evidence based, incorporate cultural ways of knowing, and dismantle structurally racist policies.",

        "dc:description": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a serious hazard to the physical and mental health of children, which limits the social activities of patients throughout their lives and places a heavy burden on families and society. The developments of communication techniques and artificial intelligence (AI) have provided new potential methods for the treatment of autism. The existing treatment systems based on AI for children with ASD focus on detecting health status and developing social skills. However, the contradiction between the terminal interaction capability and availability cannot meet the needs for real application scenarios. At the same time, the lack of diverse data cannot provide individualized care for autistic children. To explore this robot-based approach, a novel AI-based first-view-robot architecture is proposed in this article. By providing care from the first-person perspective, the proposed wearable robot overcomes the difficulty of the absence of cognitive ability in the third-view of traditional robotics and improves the social interaction ability of children with ASD. The first-view-robot architecture meets the requirements of dynamic, individualized, and highly immersed interaction services for autistic children. First, the multi-modal and multi-scene data collection processes of standard, static, and dynamic datasets are introduced in detail. Then, to comprehensively evaluate the learning ability of children with ASD through mental states and external performances, a learning assessment model with emotion correction is proposed. Besides, a wearable robot-Assisted environment perception and expression enhancement mechanism for children with ASD is realized by reinforcement learning, which can be adapted to interactive environments with optimal action policies. An interactive testbed for children with ASD treatments is demonstrated and experimental cases for test subjects are presented. Last, three open issues are discussed from data processing, robot designing, and service responding perspectives.",

        "dc:description": "The 'data pipe' model used by the existing Internet protocol stack is no longer ideal for many emerging applications, due to multimedia, multicast, mobility, machine learning, and network management challenges. A new learning-oriented network architecture is required to deal with these challenges and serve learning-centric applications in data centers, around network edges, and on mobile devices. This article focuses on the network for AI and AI for network for learning-oriented network architecture. This is done by leveraging, improving, and creating new learning techniques to determine and optimize protocol mechanisms and control policies. The new network architecture can provide ample research opportunities in network topology control, protocol design, and performance evaluation, aiming to network a truly dependable cyber-infrastructure. The learning-oriented network can also learn from applications and communications automatically and continuously while running on different infrastructures to support diverse requirements. In addition, the network can keep evolving its protocol mechanisms and control policies in an online manner. It does this while maintaining protocol security and preserving user privacy, to learn and perform more effectively and efficiently. Finally, the main challenges and opportunities of learning-oriented network are discussed, encouraging further research.",

The proliferation of invocations of ‘ethics’, especially concerning the recent debate on (the regulation of) Artificial Intelligence (AI), can be referred to as the ‘ethification’ phenomenon. This article aims to elucidate the benefits and drawbacks of the ethification of ICT governance, and its effects on the articulations of law, technology and politics in democratic constitutional states. First, the article will provide a mapping to locate where the ethics work is being produced in the EU. Second, the authors will distinguish different types of ethics based on the mapping. Third, the ethification phenomenon will be analyzed through the concepts of boundary and convergence work, where we will both see that it plays the role of ‘normative glue’ between interests of different practices to reach a common goal, but also tracing or obfuscating boundaries to claim autonomy from the law and exclude forms of non-genuine ethics. Fourth, we inquire into the nature of ethics as a practice and the consequences of ethification for the law.",

        "dc:description": "The COVID-19 crisis has accelerated an already-ongoing process of massive digitalization in economic production and services. AI and robotics are getting, for the first time, autonomous and self-learning, with human-like capabilities. The discussion about digitalization and the future of work has become even more imperative. So far, labor unions were the leading institutions representing employees. However, the rising possibility of human substitution by intelligent machines puts in question the feasibility of labor unions’ policies. This development undermines their traditional power sources, which depend on the membership of masses of paid workers and on their ability to stop production. In this context, this paper aims to discuss the challenges confronting unions in capitalist democracies. Most scholarly literature on labor relations has embraced the assumption that the digital revolution will eventually bring new, better jobs. We suggest considering an alternative scenario, namely, a digital revolution that causes mass replacement of human workers and structural, technological unemployment, which might expand our point of view, particularly for designing public policy. We suggest that unions now have two crucial roles. The first is to safeguard workers' rights and interests in the transition from an economy based on paid labor to an economy based on automated-autonomous production; and second, they should transform their primary calling from representing employees to representing the social rights of all citizens, and particularly the material interests of lay people.",

        "dc:description": "In this paper, a novel framework for guaranteeing ultra-reliable millimeter wave (mmW) communications using multiple artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) is proposed. The use of multiple AI-powered RISs allows changing the propagation direction of the signals transmitted from a mmW access point (AP) thereby improving coverage particularly for non-line-of-sight (NLoS) areas. However, due to the possibility of highly stochastic blockage over mmW links, designing an intelligent controller to jointly optimize the mmW AP beam and RIS phase shifts is a daunting task. In this regard, first, a parametric risk-sensitive episodic return is proposed to maximize the expected bitrate and mitigate the risk of mmW link blockage. Then, a closed-form approximation of the policy gradient of the risk-sensitive episodic return is analytically derived. Next, the problem of joint beamforming for mmW AP and phase shift control for mmW RISs is modeled as an identical payoff stochastic game within a cooperative multi-agent environment, in which the agents are the mmW AP and the RISs. Two centralized and distributed controllers are proposed to control the policies of the mmW AP and RISs. To directly find a near optimal solution, the parametric functional-form policies for the controllers are modeled using deep recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The deep RNN-based controllers are then trained based on the derived closed-form gradient of the risk-sensitive episodic return. It is proved that the gradient update algorithm converges to the same locally optimal parameters as the deep RNN-based centralized and distributed controllers. Simulation results show that the error between the policies of the optimal and the RNN-based controllers is less than 1.5%. Moreover, the variance of the achievable rates resulting from the deep RNN-based controllers is 60% less than the variance of the risk-averse baseline.",

        "dc:description": "Introduction: Artificial intelligence (AI) has started to be increasingly adopted in medical imaging and radiotherapy clinical practice, however research, education and partnerships have not really caught up yet to facilitate a safe and effective transition. The aim of the document is to provide baseline guidance for radiographers working in the field of AI in education, research, clinical practice and stakeholder partnerships. The guideline is intended for use by the multi-professional clinical imaging and radiotherapy teams, including all staff, volunteers, students and learners. Methods: The format mirrored similar publications from other SCoR working groups in the past. The recommendations have been subject to a rapid period of peer, professional and patient assessment and review. Feedback was sought from a range of SoR members and advisory groups, as well as from the SoR director of professional policy, as well as from external experts. Amendments were then made in line with feedback received and a final consensus was reached. Results: AI is an innovative tool radiographers will need to engage with to ensure a safe and efficient clinical service in imaging and radiotherapy. Educational provisions will need to be proportionately adjusted by Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) to offer the necessary knowledge, skills and competences for diagnostic and therapeutic radiographers, to enable them to navigate a future where AI will be central to patient diagnosis and treatment pathways. Radiography-led research in AI should address key clinical challenges and enable radiographers co-design, implement and validate AI solutions. Partnerships are key in ensuring the contribution of radiographers is integrated into healthcare AI ecosystems for the benefit of the patients and service users. Conclusion: Radiography is starting to work towards a future with AI-enabled healthcare. This guidance offers some recommendations for different areas of radiography practice. There is a need to update our educational curricula, rethink our research priorities, forge new strong clinical-academic-industry partnerships to optimise clinical practice. Specific recommendations in relation to clinical practice, education, research and the forging of partnerships with key stakeholders are discussed, with potential impact on policy and practice in all these domains. These recommendations aim to serve as baseline guidance for UK radiographers. Implications for practice: This review offers the most up-to-date recommendations for clinical practitioners, researchers, academics and service users of clinical imaging and therapeutic radiography services. Radiography practice, education and research must gradually adjust to AI-enabled healthcare systems to ensure gains of AI technologies are maximised and challenges and risks are minimised. This guidance will need to be updated regularly given the fast-changing pace of AI development and innovation.",

        "dc:description": "Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and their fields of application are among the most debated developments of recent times. Although being widely discussed academically, publicly and in policy debates, certain aspects of their research, development and application are completely ignored, namely the impact AI has on animals. Animals are affected by the research on and development of this technology since it partially relies on animal testing. In addition, AI is also being applied to improve monitoring and marketing of animals in an agricultural context. We argue that it is insufficient to exclude these aspects from debates around AI. In addition to the surveillance-applications on animals, which can be evaluated as impacting them negatively, AI applications, from which individual animals can benefit, do exist. These can primarily be found in nature and wildlife conservation, as we point out at the end of the paper. By providing an overview on how these technologies are applied to animals and how this affects them, this paper aims to fill a previously existing research gap.",

        "dc:description": "Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are set to revolutionize established industries. Drawing on delegation theory, this article extends the marketing literature by explaining technology, consumer, and country differences in the formation of demand for AI-empowered consumer products (AI products). Based on hierarchical linear modeling of 2,775 consumer evaluations of automobile add-on autonomous driving systems across five countries, this study finds that the utilitarian (related to efficient goal achievement), hedonic (related to emotions), and symbolic (related to the consumer's self-concept) dimensions of perceived value all contribute substantially to AI product demand. Regarding technology differences, the degree of AI product autonomy enhances the effects of both hedonic and symbolic value and weakens the effect of utilitarian value on AI product demand. Regarding country differences, cultural performance orientation enhances the effect of utilitarian value on AI product demand. Regarding consumer differences, a consumer's independent self-construal weakens the effects of hedonic and symbolic value. Moreover, a consumer's inherent activeness weakens the effect of utilitarian value and strengthens the effect of symbolic value on AI product demand. Based on these results, the article discusses implications for marketing scholars and practitioners and for public policy-makers.",

        "dc:description": "Energy supply of megacities is considered as an active research topic in the new aspects of urban management, especially in developing countries like Iran. With an introduction to the sustainable development goals, the smart city concept presents a novel idea for providing energy in a city with the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI), renewable energy, such as Photovoltaic (PV) technologies, and Transformational Participation (TP) based on motivational programs for citizens. This study aims to evaluate the electrical energy consumption in Mashhad, Iran, based on machine learning tools and present the dynamic strategies for promoting citizens’ willingness for renewable energy generation based on the experts’ knowledge. The main novelty of this research is simultaneous application of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and statistical analysis for creating a Decision Support System (DSS). Then, the solar energy potential is appraised by the PV system simulation tool during one year in our case study in Mashhad, Iran. Furthermore, a Classical Delphi (CD) method is applied for motivational strategies and further TP implementation. In particular, the motivational strategies are suggested by 45 experts and then are prioritized in sequential expert meetings. The outcomes of this research indicate that the ANN model can successfully forecast the electrical energy consumption in summer and winter periods with a 99% accuracy. Then, based on the solar energy computations in the PV system, the peak of electrical energy consumption can be controlled in the hottest and coldest months. Last but not least, the superposition of experts’ and citizens’ opinions reveal A4 (sharing benefits of optimized costs with the citizens by solar energy generation), B2 (reducing the electrical energy cost for solar energy generation, especially in peak times) and C1 (creating the energy coin in the city with credits instead of spending money in urban activities fits to solar energy generation) as the main motivational strategies for solar energy generation in short, middle and long-term planning horizons.",

        "dc:description": "The exponential growth of solar power has been witnessed in the past decade and is projected by the ambitious policy targets. Nevertheless, the proliferation of solar energy poses challenges to power system operations, mostly due to its uncertainty, locational specificity, and variability. The prevalence of smart grids enables artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to mitigate solar integration problems with massive amounts of solar energy data. Different AI subfields (e.g., machine learning, deep learning, ensemble learning, and metaheuristic learning) have brought breakthroughs in solar energy, especially in its grid integration. However, AI research in solar integration is still at the preliminary stage, and is lagging behind the AI mainstream. Aiming to inspire deep AI involvement in the solar energy domain, this paper presents a taxonomical overview of AI applications in solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. Text mining techniques are first used as an assistive tool to collect, analyze, and categorize a large volume of literature in this field. Then, based on the constructed literature infrastructure, recent advancements in AI applications to solar forecasting, PV array detection, PV system fault detection, design optimization, and maximum power point tracking control problems are comprehensively reviewed. Current challenges and future trends of AI applications in solar integration are also discussed for each application theme.",

        "dc:description": "Artificial intelligence and robotics are rapidly advancing. Humans are increasingly often affected by autonomous machines making choices with moral repercussions. At the same time, classical research in robotics shows that people are adverse to robots that appear eerily human—a phenomenon commonly referred to as the uncanny valley effect. Yet, little is known about how machines’ appearances influence how human evaluate their moral choices. Here we integrate the uncanny valley effect into moral psychology. In two experiments we test whether humans evaluate identical moral choices made by robots differently depending on the robots’ appearance. Participants evaluated either deontological (“rule based”) or utilitarian (“consequence based”) moral decisions made by different robots. The results provide first indication that people evaluate moral choices by robots that resemble humans as less moral compared to the same moral choices made by humans or non-human robots: a moral uncanny valley effect. We discuss the implications of our findings for moral psychology, social robotics and AI-safety policy.",

The authors discuss the challenges involved in making machine learning-based AI explainable. Firstly, that the explanations must be adapted to different stakeholders (end-users, policy makers, industries, utilities etc.) with different levels of technical knowledge (managers, engineers, technicians, etc.) in different application domains. Secondly, that it is important to develop an evaluation framework and standards in order to measure the effectiveness of the provided explanations at the human and the technical levels. This book gathers research contributions aiming at the development and/or the use of XAI techniques in order to address the aforementioned challenges in different applications such as healthcare, finance, cybersecurity, and document summarization. It allows highlighting the benefits and requirements of using explainable models in different application domains in order to provide guidance to readers to select the most adapted models to their specified problem and conditions. • Includes recent developments of the use of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) in order to address the challenges of digital transition and cyber-physical systems; • Provides a textual scientific description of the use of XAI in order to address the challenges of digital transition and cyber-physical systems; • Presents examples and case studies in order to increase transparency and understanding of the methodological concepts.",

In recent years, with the country's encouragement, policy relaxation, and the continuous \"Chinese medicine awakening upsurge,\"\"AI + Chinese medicine + health\"has become a national strategy and development aspiration. As an essential part of Chinese medicine, TCM nursing is guided by the holistic view of TCM and the concept of dialectical nursing. It can significantly improve by providing TCM characteristics of daily life nursing, diet nursing, emotional nursing, and appropriate nursing techniques. The life quality of patients meets the patients' needs for medical and health services. At present, the application of artificial intelligence technology of Chinese medicine nursing is still in its infancy. This article aims to review the application of artificial intelligence in dialectical nursing, daily life nursing, diet nursing, emotional nursing, and traditional Chinese medicine nursing technology. It also discusses the potential challenges of artificial intelligence and its prospects for application. Provide a reference for the development of the field.",
