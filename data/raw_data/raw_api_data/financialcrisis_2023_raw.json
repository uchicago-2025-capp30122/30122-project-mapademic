        "dc:description": "In times of financial crisis as well as during the COVID-19 era, gold and crude oil are the two commodities that have the most influence on global stock markets and the real economy. But research has mostly focused on the effects of these commodities' prices on their own, and the volatility of these commodities' prices as a whole hasn't gotten much attention. This research paper evaluates the impacts of crude oil prices volatility on shares marketplaces. This research examines the impact of crude oil uncertainty on the overall market returns in several economic sectors (China, Japan, the USA, France, and Germany) between 2000 and 2020 using the importance of the crude oil prices volatility index by applying a Quantile-on-Quantile regression(Q-Q), including dynamic copula with Markov-Switching. The results depict that because the effect of the OVX changes crosswise every single quantile level of stock return, it is cumbersome to ascertain the changes within the adverse impacts under varied stock market circumstances. Equally, to derive a comprehensive understanding of the correlation between crude costs volatility and stock returns, we utilize twofold quantile regression and quantile-quantile regression methods. We interpret these different features' impacts by applying the quantile regression approximates. Our experiential findings show that crude costs uncertainty has lop-sided impacts on stock returns; more so, these disproportionate performances alternate based not merely on the level of shares returns nonetheless equally crude market circumstances. More so, greater values match a robust risk decrease. Further, we observed heterogenous hedging effectiveness among the varied United States stock sectors. The findings demonstrate that growing crude prices volatility obtains an adverse impact on stock returns when the dual crude costs volatility and stock returns are minimal. Nevertheless, when shares returns are greater plus crude prices, volatility is minimal; growing crude volatility increases stock returns.",

        "dc:description": "In the era of \"Internet plus,\" the world economy is becoming more and more globalized and informationalized. China's enterprises are facing unprecedented opportunities for their operation and development. However, it is also facing the financial uncertainties brought about by the fluctuations of the general economic environment, and the company is facing increasing financial risks. The reason why most enterprises encounter a serious financial crisis or even close down in the later stage is that they do not pay full attention to the initial financial problems and do not take effective measures to deal with the crisis in time. Financial risk warning has become an important part of modern enterprise financial management. This paper mainly puts forward the optimized BP neural system as the financial early warning model and ensures its high prediction accuracy. In the research, the operation principle and related reasoning process of the model are described, its shortcomings are analyzed, and solutions are put forward. Through the financial risk analysis of listed companies from 2017 to 2020, we find that the correct rate of the prediction results of the financial distress of normal companies in the selected companies based on the optimized BPNN has reached more than 80%, which proves the effectiveness of the optimized BPNN.",

        "dc:description": "The environmental emergency and energy crisis are serious challenges exposed to Europe, which results in a fundamental shift in the linkages regarding fossil fuel, renewable energy and carbon trade markets. This study investigates the spillover effects based on the quantile VAR network. We find that the impact of the extreme market on the connectedness network of underlying assets proves to be more pronounced compared to the standard conditions. The risk spillovers in extreme cases originate primarily from the renewable energy and carbon markets, while fossil fuels account for the most significant contributor under normal circumstances. Hence, investors are supposed to develop dynamic and flexible portfolios to hedge potential risks. Concerning the governments, corresponding initiatives should be implemented to facilitate the continuous evolution of the European Union carbon trading system and the energy transition. These provide a feasible solution to Europe's dual dilemma regarding energy security and the climate emergency.",

In this paper, we analyze the response of European and global stock markets alongside a representative sample of commodities. We compare the war response against the recent Covid-19 pandemic and the not-too-distant 2008 global financial crisis. Applying a Markov-switching HAR model on volatility proxies, estimates are made of synchronization, duration and intensity measures for each event. In broad terms, stock markets and commodities respond most rapidly to the Russian invasion; and post-invasion crisis intensity is noticeably smaller compared to both the Covid-19 and the GFC. Wheat and nickel are the most affected commodities due to the prominent exporter status of the two countries.",

        "dc:description": "This study examines the market reaction to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine on the leading European Union stock market indices employing the event study method, cross-sectional and network analysis We find adverse event day impact on the stock market indices. Further, Poland, Denmark, and Portugal exhibit positive cumulative abnormal returns post-event. A few developed nations are insignificant to the war event. The findings are attributable to the geographic proximity to the war zone and the market efficiency. While the developed markets and NATO nations exhibit positive returns, the economic sanctions and the fear of reduced exports negatively drive abnormal returns during the post-event windows. Contrary to previous studies, stronger past returns negatively drive the returns during the post-event windows. Additional analysis on the mapping of financial networks provides relevant insights into systemic integration between EU stock markets, especially during the war.",

The benchmark results show that green finance can directly drive decarbonization of the economy. High-level openness, government support, human capital and urbanization are prerequisites of this effect, and green finance is more effective in promoting decarbonization in areas with high carbon intensity. Moreover, green finance drives economic decarbonization by promoting economic growth, technical innovation, industrial upgrading, and renewable energy transition. Internet availability, financial level and higher education have moderating roles in boosting this effect. Furthermore, the implementation of green finance policy also contributes to decarbonization. The robustness of the basic result is proven with several methods, thus strengthening the reliability of the basic conclusion in this paper. Based on the above main findings, targeted policy recommendations concerning how to further develop green finance are proposed in this paper.",

        "dc:description": "In the backdrop of the recent covid-19 pandemic there is a renewed interest to understand the interlinkages between dirty and clean energies. In this regard, the study examines the co-movement structure between clean energy stocks and dirty energies before and during the covid-19 outbreak. The study analyses the interlinkages between the underlying markets by utilizing a vast sample of dirty energies namely crude oil, heating oil, gas oil, gasoline and natural gas, whereas clean energy sector is proxied by S&P Global clean energy index and Wilder Hill clean energy index. We make use of rolling window wavelet approach and wavelet coherence analysis to identify interdependencies between the clean energy stocks and dirty energies. The results exhibit weak linkages between clean energy equities and dirty energies in the short-run, while; we also record few occasions of high co-movements among dirty and clean energy markets in the long-run. Noticeably, a distinct decoupling effect persisted between dirty and clean energy markets. In addition, the findings also illustrate that clean energy market is relatively isolated from dirty energies during the recent pandemic crisis, amplifying portfolio diversification benefits across clean and dirty energy markets. The findings of the study hold meaningful insights for investors, policy makers and other market participants in energy financial markets.",

While unique triggers sparked each of these crises, they all exposed extreme concentration within the global industrial food system at multiple scales–at the field, country, and global market levels. This multi-level concentration heightens vulnerability to worldwide food crises that have profound consequences for the world’s most marginalized populations. With a focus on staple grains production and trade, this contribution traces the origins of the high degrees of multi-level concentration in the industrial food system and draws insights for debates on the current food systems transformation agenda.",

        "dc:description": "Financing strategies and energy performance have been extensively studied previously, and researchers frequently overlook the co-movements of integration of financial inclusion and energy performance index in the E7 Context. To address this gap, current research estimates the co-movement between the financial inclusion index and sustainable energy performance index to reflect the consequences of the COVID-19 crisis. Our findings show that in E7 economies, China exceeds the other nations in terms of energy performance. With a steady score, Russia is second in the group. Indonesia and Turkey are respectively fourth and fifth, and their total results show excellent prospective performances for sustainability. Mexico and Brazil follow this ranking with bad results and the lowest scores reported in the study results. The study findings are helpful for policy formulation and assessment. The study presented recommendations about financial inclusion and energy management practices in COVID-19 and delivered insights about the energy performance index in E7 economies.",

        "dc:description": "This paper examines the asymmetric effects of the United States Economic Policy Uncertainty (USEPU), Geopolitical Threats (GPRT), Geopolitical Acts (GPRA), and the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil on Green Bond returns. Our study analyses USEPU, GPRT, GPRA, WTI, and Green Bond monthly data from September 2012 to August 2022. By applying the Nonlinear Autoregressive Distributed Lags (NARDL) model, our empirical evidence shows that in the short run, the return on green bonds is negatively affected by an increase in USEPU and GPRA positively affected by an increase in GPRT and WTI. In the long run, the return on green bonds is negatively affected by an increase in USEPU, GPRA, and GPRT but positively affected by WTI. Considering the climate crisis, looking at these findings in the context of green bonds is essential to entice green investments. Policymakers should use our results for a policy design to mitigate green bond market volatility caused by external uncertainties and risks. Furthermore, we conclude that uncertainties should be considered when investing in green bonds and managing investment portfolios.",

The study considers six financial domains: stock markets, portfolio management, cryptocurrency, forex markets, financial crisis, bankruptcy and insolvency. We provide an overview of previously proposed techniques in these areas by examining 126 selected articles across 44 reputed journals. The main contributions of this review include an extensive examination of data characteristics and features used for model training, evaluation of validation approaches, and model performance addressing each financial problem. A systematic literature review methodology, PRISMA, is used to carry out this comprehensive review. The study also analyses bibliometric information to understand the current status of research focused on machine learning in finance. The study finally points out possible research directions which might lead to new inquiries in machine learning and finance.",

        "dc:description": "Background and Aims: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) impacts significantly health and social care systems as well as society through premature mortality and disability, with patients requiring care from relatives. Previous pan-European estimates of the economic burden of CVD are now outdated. This study aims to provide novel, up-to-date evidence on the economic burden across the 27 European Union (EU) countries in 2021. Methods: Aggregate country-specific resource use data on morbidity, mortality, and health, social and informal care were obtained from international sources, such as the Statistical Office of the European Communities, enhanced by data from the European Society of Cardiology Atlas programme and patient-level data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe. Country-specific unit costs were used, with cost estimates reported on a per capita basis, after adjustment for price differentials. Results: CVD is estimated to cost the EU €282 billion annually, with health and long-term care accounting for €155 billion (55%), equalling 11% of EU-health expenditure. Productivity losses accounted for 17% (€48 billion), whereas informal care costs were €79 billion (28%). CVD represented a cost of €630 per person, ranging from €381 in Cyprus to €903 in Germany. Coronary heart disease accounted for 27% (€77 billion) and cerebrovascular diseases for 27% (€76 billion) of CVD costs. Conclusions: This study provides contemporary estimates of the wide-ranging impact of CVD on all aspects of the economy. The data help inform evidence-based policies to reduce the impact of CVD, promoting care access and better health outcomes and economic sustainability.",

However, once a subsidy shock occurs, caused at the point at which the subsidy expires, bankruptcy risk, and the business strategy known as greenwashing, potentially arise. This paper seeks to identify the relationship between subsidy shock and greenwashing through accessing information on Chinese listed companies during the period 2011 to 2021, and we have raised several findings accordingly. First, subsidy shock has a significant and positive effect on greenwashing behaviors. Second, we further uncover that companies with high financial risk or that are financially constrained are strongly motivated to greenwash after a subsidy expires. Companies that are motivated by subsidy shock to greenwash are significantly present in low competition markets. Moreover, we show that the greenwashing is created by reducing investment in innovation and efficiency, and increasing green innovation costs when organizations are facing financial risks. By identifying and deploying different measurements of greenwashing, we show our results to be robust.",

        "dc:description": "Climate and economic policy are closely correlated with energy consumption. This study investigates the bi-directional causality between renewable (REC) and non-renewable energy consumption (NEC) and policy uncertainties. The time-varying bootstrap rolling window causality test considers structural changes and parameter instability. The results show that the causality between REC and climate policy uncertainty (CPU) is both negative and positive, which mainly stems from the attitudes of authorities towards climate change. If the Administration is positive for climate change mitigation, the correlation between REC and CPU is positive; otherwise, it is negative. The nexus between NEC and CPU is mainly positive, except during global financial crisis periods. This reflects that climate policies are affected by financial crises due to financial constraints. For comparison, we further analyse the dynamic correlation between energy consumption and economic policy uncertainty (EPU). EPU has a significant negative impact on REC in most subperiods, while it has a positive impact on NEC. This can be explained by the fact that non-renewable energy is cheap and convenient to use during economic downturns. Moreover, crude oil has strategic reserve value, especially in the turmoil periods. Regarding policy implications, harmonious and coherent climate and economic policies are important for energy transition.",

        "dc:description": "The adverse effects of the high-power energy consumption by cryptocurrencies on the environment and sustainability have raised the interest of a large body of policymakers and market participants. We apply a network approach to investigate the dependency across clean energy, green markets, and cryptocurrencies from 1 January 2018 to 30 November 2021. Our results indicate that sustainable investments, particularly DJSI and ESGL, play a pivotal role in the network system during the COVID-19 crisis. We find that green bonds are the least integrated with the other financial markets, suggesting their significant role in providing diversification benefits to investors. Rolling windows estimation shows that the dependency across the examined marked increased sharply during the COVID-19 crisis, especially between March 2020 and March 2021, after which it faded and became weak and stable until the end of the sample period. Results of the centrality network are consistent with the dependency network analysis.",

        "dc:description": "In recent years, financial markets have been hit hard by the Great Financial Crisis of 2008, the acceleration of climate change, and now the COVID-19 pandemic. The result of these events is the acceleration of the implementation of a new model of socioeconomic development of societies referred to as the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) model. It has been particularly evident in the financial investment sector. Analyses of the relative performance of ESG funds is inconclusive due to the lack of a clear definition of responsible investments, and insufficient quality of the available data and ESG ratings. However, most of the studies find a positive correlation between ESG factors and company's financial performance. The analyses showed that these positive results are more pronounced over the longer term and impact the stock prices of those companies. ESG funds offer better downside protection during crises in relation to traditional funds. Despite the lack of legal barriers, the Polish economy has experienced very long delays in implementing the ESG model and the gap is even more pronounced in the financial industry. This is surprising as Poland is a very interesting market for sustainable investment given its current underdevelopment and overall potential related to green transformation. In Poland, only 17 investment funds deeply integrate ESG criteria. Educational and communication barriers have been identified as the main obstacles to the development of the sustainable finance market in Poland. Education of all participants in investment processes is a prerequisite for success.",

We develop and estimate a Bayesian model of factor replication that leads to different conclusions. The majority of asset pricing factors (i) can be replicated; (ii) can be clustered into 13 themes, the majority of which are significant parts of the tangency portfolio; (iii) work out-of-sample in a new large data set covering 93 countries; and (iv) have evidence that is strengthened (not weakened) by the large number of observed factors.",

        "dc:description": "The purpose of this paper is to compare the performance of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) in developing and developed countries prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic; the study also seeks to reveal the impact of the COVID-19 on the performance of ESG during the pandemic period. Based on a large international panel dataset of 12,325 company-year observations covering 2016–2021, panel regression analysis examined the study hypotheses and achieved the study objectives. The findings indicate that companies have taken precautions against the threats of the COVID-19 pandemic by ensuring compliance with ESG performance to prove their ethical behavior during a crisis. Our findings call into question the notion that companies in developed countries outperform companies in developing countries in terms of ESG performance. As a result, companies in emerging markets outperform companies in developed markets regarding environmental performance, while developed markets focus on social performance. Besides, the ESG performance is positively and significantly affected by the COVID-19, which indicates that during crises, it is important for companies to comply with ethical behavior and the most acceptable in societies. Also, the pandemic has a positive impact on both environmental and social performance, while it has a negative impact on governance performance alone. A considerable body of the literature has addressed the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on various aspects of a company’s financial and non-financial practices. However, limited effort was given to ESG performance. The current study fills this gap by evaluating the direct effect of the COVID-19 crisis on the ESG performance in developing and developed countries. It also provides insight into the ESG performance and corporate behavior and obligations.",

Proponents of the polycrisis model, such as prominent economic historian and Financial Times contributing editor Adam Tooze, propose polycrisis as a marker of our age, capturing overlapping and interconnected crises beyond cause and effect. In his article, the authors offer some prompts for considering the usefulness and limitations of polycrisis for the anthropological toolkit. The authors cautiously welcome the polycrisis trope as a multidimensional means to account for the consequences of interrelated crises in an unprecedented era.",

        "dc:description": "Sustainability in business and ESG (environmental, social, and governance) in finance have exploded in popularity among researchers and practitioners. We surveyed 1,141 primary peer-reviewed papers and 27 meta-reviews (based on ∼1,400 underlying studies) published between 2015 and 2020. Aggregate conclusions from a sample suggest that the financial performance of ESG investing has on average been indistinguishable from conventional investing (with one in three studies indicating superior performance)–in contrast with research in the wider management literature as well as industry reports. Until recently top finance journals did not publish climate change related studies, yet these studies capture the frontier of corporate risk and ESG investment strategies. We developed three propositions: first, ESG integration as a strategy seems to perform better than screening or divestment; second, ESG investing provides asymmetric benefits, especially during a social or economic crisis; and third, decarbonization strategies can potentially capture a climate risk premium.",

        "dc:description": "This paper develops a novel energy-related uncertainty index (the EUI). We use the text analysis of the monthly country reports of the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) to construct the EUI, which measures the uncertainties related to energy markets for 28 developed and developing countries from 1996 to 2022 using. We use the vector autoregression (VAR) model and a range of other estimation methods to evaluate and check the efficacy of the EUI. The EUI appears to respond strongly to oil shocks, including sharp drops in oil prices. We also find that the EUI and other measures of uncertainties spiked during the global financial crisis, the European debt crises, the Covid-19 pandemic, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Further analysis confirms that an increase in the EUI tends to hinder economic activities and outputs, not only at a country level but also at an industry level.",

        "dc:description": "Purpose: This study examines the market reaction to the World Health Organization (WHO) announcement of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a global pandemic on the emerging equity markets and compares the reaction with developed markets. This study also compares the market reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic with the market reactions to the 2008 global financial crisis. Design/methodology/approach: Using the Morgan Stanley Capital International daily stock indices data and the Carhart and the GARCH(1,1) models for an event study, the authors examine the cumulative abnormal returns during 30 and 10 trading days and the extended 60 days before and after the WHO pandemic announcement. It also compares the market reactions during the COVID-19 pandemic with the reactions to the Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy announcement during the 2008 global financial crisis. Findings: This study finds that the COVID-19 pandemic had a significantly greater negative impact to the stock markets in emerging countries than in the developed countries. The negative impact on the emerging markets is more pronounced for firms with small market capitalizations and for growth stocks. The negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is stronger in the energy and financial sectors in both emerging and developed markets. The positive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic occurred in healthcare and telecommunications for the emerging markets and information technology for the developed markets. This study also finds that the equity markets in both emerging and developed countries recovered faster from the COVID-19 pandemic relative to the 2008 global financial crisis. Social implications: Investors' desire to diversify their risks across different countries and sectors in the emerging markets could bring superior returns. The diversification strategies bring critical financial supports to forestall the contagion of COVID-19, to protect lives, and to save the emerging economies, especially for those financially constrained countries that are facing twin health and economic shocks by channeling their investments to countries with weak healthcare systems. Originality/value: This study extends the literature that examines market reactions to stock market shocks by examining the market reactions to the COVID-19 outbreak on the emerging and developed equity markets across different market capitalizations, valuation and sectors. This study also finds that the markets recovered quicker from the COVID-19 pandemic announcement than during the 2008 global financial crisis.",

        "dc:description": "Global food insecurity has become a significant concern, especially for emerging economies. The crisis has been exacerbated recently due to the intense supply chain disruption resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing Russia–Ukraine war. Agriculture 4.0, which combines conventional agriculture with various modern cutting-edge technologies, might help in this regard to improve the food supply and food security. In such a context, it is essential to accurately identify the pertinent drivers of Agriculture 4.0 implementation to ensure sustainability and food security in emerging economies. This study, therefore, aims to classify, assess, and analyze the hierarchical relationships among the drivers of Agriculture 4.0 in the context of an emerging economy like Bangladesh, combining Pareto analysis, fuzzy theory, total interpretative structural modeling (TISM), and Matriced’ Impacts Cruoses Multiplication Applique a un Classement (MICMAC) analysis. Based on the literature review and expert feedback, eighteen factors were identified initially. After employing Pareto analysis, the top thirteen factors have been further analyzed using fuzzy TISM and fuzzy MICMAC to examine their interrelationships. The study findings indicate that “Automation & Robotics to lessen the usage of manual labor”, “Augmented reality (AR) for training new farmers and guiding tool evaluation,” and “Providing adequate financial incentives to impoverished farmers for building modern storage facilities” are the three most influential drivers to implement Agriculture 4.0. This study is expected to contribute significantly to future innovation and development in the agriculture sector, eliminate hunger and improve regional food security. It has the potential to assist the practitioners and industry leaders of emerging economies in strategic decision-making in achieving sustainability in the agricultural sector and thus achieve the relevant SDGs.",

        "dc:description": "The UK, and other high-income countries, are experiencing substantial increases in living costs. Several overlapping and intersecting economic crises threaten physical and mental health in the immediate and longer term. Policy responses may buffer against the worst effects (e.g. welfare support) or further undermine health (e.g. austerity). We explore fundamental causes underpinning the cost-of-living crisis, examine potential pathways by which the crisis could impact population health and use a case study to model potential impacts of one aspect of the crisis on a specific health outcome. Our modelling illustrates how policy approaches can substantially protect health and avoid exacerbating health inequalities. Targeting support at vulnerable households is likely to protect health most effectively. The current crisis is likely to be the first of many in era of political and climate uncertainty. More refined integrated economic and health modelling has the potential to inform policy integration, or ‘health in all policies’.",

We employ the wavelet analysis and the spillover index methodology from January 1, 2018 to May 15, 2020. We report that the COVID-19-triggered significant increase in co-movements and spillovers in returns and volatility between the rare earths and renewable energy returns and volatility. The rare earths act as net recipient of both return and volatility spillovers, while the clean energy stocks are net transmitters of return and volatility spillovers before and during the COVID-19 crisis. The solar and wind stocks are net transmitters/receivers of spillovers before/during the pandemic. The remaining markets shift from net spillover receivers to transmitters or vice versa; evidencing the effects of the pandemic. Our results show that cross-market hedge strategies may have their efficiency impaired during the periods of crises implying a necessity of portfolio rebalancing.",

        "dc:description": "Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) are leading causes of disability and premature mortality. At a global level, over 300 million people are estimated to suffer from major depressive disorders, equivalent to 4·4% of the world’s population. Pandemic era stressors have increased rates for depression and anxiety by upwards of 25%. The goal of this study is to estimate the prevalence and economic burden of depression and anxiety symptoms in Singapore after the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: An existing web panel was queried between April 2022 and June 2022. Adult participants aged > 21 years old who screened positive for depression and anxiety symptoms based on the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4) Screener were eligible for participation. Prevalence estimates were quantified by dividing the number of respondents who screened positive for these symptoms by the total number of respondents. Participants who screened positive were asked about healthcare utilization, days missed from work, and reduced productivity due to these symptoms. These values were then monetized and scaled based on prevalence and population counts to generate per capita and total annual costs. Results: Two thousand three hundred forty-eight respondents filled out the PHQ-4 depression/anxiety screener on behalf of the 5,725 adults living in their households (including respondents themselves). Prevalence estimates were calculated based on the responses recorded for these 5,725 adults. 14.1% adults had symptoms consistent with depression and 15.2% had symptoms consistent with anxiety. In total, 20.0% may experience symptoms consistent with at least one of these two conditions, yet approximately half reported never being formally diagnosed. 350 respondents screened positive for depression or anxiety symptoms and thus were eligible to fill out the healthcare utilization, presenteeism, and absenteeism survey. Direct annual healthcare costs due to depression and anxiety symptoms averaged Singapore dollar (SGD) $1,050 for these respondents. The employed subset (n = 304) missed an extra 17.7 days of work on average per year, which translates to SGD $4,980 per worker. These workers also reported being ~ 40% less productive at work, which equates to SGD $28,720 in economic losses annually. In total, these symptoms caused SGD $15.7 billion in increased costs. Presenteeism accounts for 81.6% of this total (SGD $12.8 billion), absenteeism for 14.2% (SGD $2.3 billion) and healthcare accounts for 4.2% (SGD $0.7 billion). Conclusions: The health and economic burden associated with depression and anxiety symptoms is large in Singapore, representing 2.9% of Singapore’s gross domestic product (GDP). Employers and governments should look to identify effective remediation strategies, including strategies to address the high rates of undiagnosed cases. Increasing psychiatric resources, general practitioner mental health competency, access to peer support, and increased efforts to reduce mental health stigma should be considered to address this growing public health crisis.",

We apply it to quantifying connectedness among global stock and foreign exchange (forex) markets, and demonstrate that measuring volatility spillovers of both stock and forex markets simultaneously could support a more comprehensive view for financial risk contagion. We find that (i) stock markets transmit the larger spillovers to forex markets, (ii) the French stock market is the largest risk transmitter in multilayer networks, while some Asian stock markets and most forex markets are net risk receivers, and (iii) interconnected multilayer networks could signal the financial instability during the global financial crisis and the COVID-19 crisis. Our work provides a new perspective and method for studying the cross-market risk contagion.",

Considering the markets volatilities due to economic and financial uncertainties that can drive the informational price inefficiencies across the markets, this study compares the asymmetric price efficiency of regional ESG markets by using an asymmetric multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis before and during COVID-19 crisis. We then examine whether global factors influence the asymmetric efficiency of regional ESG markets. Our findings reveal that COVID-19 outbreak reduced the efficiency of regional ESG markets, except for Europe, which sustained its efficiency even during the pandemic. Moreover, global factors drive the efficiency of regional ESG markets significantly before and during COVID-19. A major implication of our findings stems from the fact that a contagion reduces the efficiency of the markets while stable economic conditions make those markets informationally efficient.",

        "dc:description": "Chemicals, essential materials for modern life, emit substantial greenhouse gases during production and use. Like the other carbon-intensive industries, the chemical industry is a complex and diverse industry to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. Decarbonizing the chemical industry is critical to overcoming the climate crisis and building a sustainable and vibrant future. We conducted a comprehensive and systematic review screening more than 5.6 million articles and thoroughly analyzing a shortlist of 246 studies about the decarbonization innovations of the chemical industry. Based on the review results, we identified the sociotechnical system of the industry into four groups: raw materials, chemical making processes, chemical product making and usage, and waste management and recycling. Our review also assesses the opportunities, challenges, current and emerging practices, and 71 potentially transformative technologies for the decarbonization of the chemical industry. The decarbonization innovations for the industry create environmental, financial, and collateral benefits. Still, there are also barriers across economic, technical, political, and behavioral aspects to decarbonization. To overcome those barriers, the review suggests policy and social instruments. We lastly outlined research gaps and future agendas for the chemical industry's decarbonization.",

        "dc:description": "Considering the new role of social media to quickly effect bank runs, it is critical to investigate the impact of the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) collapse on US market sectors. Using an event study approach, we identify significant (negative) abnormal returns on the event date only for the financial, materials, and real estate sectors, with no sector reactions for the pre-event period. The most significant impact, not surprisingly, was to the financial sector. Results are consistent with the SVB failure not being anticipated by investors and subsequent impacts to most sectors being shared at the market level with limited heterogeneity.",

Although policy changes and developments affect financial asset price volatility, unpredictable climate policy changes make policy decisions less certain. This study investigates the spillover effects of climate policy uncertainty (CPU) on Chinese stock market volatility in the realized GARCH-MIDAS framework. To capture more information on asset price volatility, we further employ 5-min high-frequency data. The empirical results provide strong evidence to support that our strategy can successfully improve volatility forecasting accuracy. First, in-sample results indicate that CPU has a significant effect on stock price volatility. Second, out-of-sample tests confirm that the extended model that considers both CPU and high-frequency data exhibits the best predictive ability. In addition, various robustness tests strongly demonstrate our main findings. Thus, this paper demonstrates that weather effects exist in the stock market and reminds investors that they should pay more attention to climate policies in the current period of the climate crisis.",

        "dc:description": "Understanding the interactions among climate change, carbon emission allowance trading, crude oil and renewable energy stock markets, especially the role of climate change in this system is of great significance for policy makers, energy producers/consumers and relevant investors. The present paper aims to quantify the time-varying connectedness effects among the four factors by using the TVP-VAR based extensions of both time- and frequency-domain connectedness index measurements proposed by Antonakakis et al. (2020) and Ellington and Barunik (2021) [8,48]. The empirical results suggest that, firstly, the average total connectedness among climate change, carbon emission allowance trading, crude oil and renewable energy stock markets is not so strong for the heterogenous fundamentals underlying them. Nevertheless, the time-varying total connectedness fluctuates fiercely through May 2005 to September 2021, varying from about 8% to 30% and rocket to very high levels during the global subprime mortgage crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the total connectedness mainly centers on the short-term frequency, i.e., 1–3 months. Secondly, climate change is generally the leading information contributor among the four factors, although not particularly strong, and its leading role also performs mainly on the short-term frequency (1–3 months). Thirdly, renewable energy stock market and crude oil market show tight interactions between them and they are the two major bridges of information exchanges across various time frequencies (horizons) in this system. Finally, we confirm the evidence that the primary net connectedness contributor and receiver switch frequently across different time frequencies, implying that it is extremely essential for policy makers, energy producers/consumers and investors to make time-horizon-specific regulatory, production/purchasing or investment decisions when facing the uncertain effects of climate change on the interactions among carbon emission allowance, crude oil and renewable energy stock markets.",

For that aim, this research applies the TVP-VAR model, and it also computes the optimal weights and hedge ratios for the Defi assets–sector equity portfolios using the DCC-GARCH model. Our main findings reveal that static connectedness is slightly economy- and sector-dependent. Regarding the dynamic connectedness, as expected, the total spillover index changes over time, showing a cruel impact of the global pandemic declaration. Net spillover indices show relevant differences between the Defi assets and certain sectors (net receivers) and sectors such as industrials, materials and information technology (time-varying net transmitters). Finally, the optimal hedge ratios reveal similar levels of coverage in all the periods analyzed, with slight upturns in the cost of such coverage in the crisis period caused by COVID-19.",

        "dc:description": "We estimate the risk premium for firm-level climate change exposure among S&P 500 stocks and its time-series evolution between 2005 to 2020. Exposure reflects the attention paid by market participants in earnings calls to a firm's climate-related risks and opportunities. When extracted from realized returns, the unconditional risk premium is insignificant but exhibits a period with a positive risk premium before the financial crisis and a steady increase thereafter. Forward-looking expected return proxies deliver an unconditionally positive risk premium with maximum values of 0.5%-1% p.a., depending on the proxy, between 2011 and 2014. The risk premium has been lower since 2015, especially when the expected return proxy explicitly accounts for the higher opportunities and lower crash risks that characterize high-exposure stocks. This finding arises as the priced part of the risk premium primarily originates from uncertainty about climate-related upside opportunities. In the time series, the risk premium is negatively associated with green innovation; Big Three holdings; and environmental, social, and governance fund flows and positively associated with climate change adaptation programs.",

        "dc:description": "The crisis triggered by the COVID-19 emergency is changing the competitive landscape by pushing companies to adapt to sudden change. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that want to survive must innovate their business. Antifragility represents the capability of a system to absorb shocks and get better, allowing it to overcome a crisis and improve its performance. The use of digital technologies by enterprises is expected to play an important role in building antifragility. The aim of this paper is to study how digital technologies can contribute to the development of antifragility in SMEs. This study analyzed the responses to the COVID-19 pandemic crisis of six small and medium-sized enterprises located in Calabria, South of Italy. All the six enterprises have turned the crisis into a business opportunity developing new products, investing in marketing and communication, or starting new collaborations. The research identifies the factors leveraged by the investigated organizations that enabled this anti fragile behavior. They include slack financial resources, strategic agility, and relations with research institutions. The study highlights the positive impact of digital technologies in developing antifragility. Results were summarized into research propositions to be tested in future confirmatory studies. The findings of the study are useful for researchers interested in antifragility and digital technologies in SMEs. The results are also important for entrepreneurs and managers of SMEs, since they can support their decisions in terms of survival and transformation of their companies.",

The pandemic has also threatened the survival of the firms, which has drawn the attention of policymakers and corporate governance practitioners around the world. In this study, we focus on how corporate governance practices can help firms to survive during COVID-19 crisis. For this purpose, we take insights from prior crises by reviewing leading business journals articles and identify key corporate governance mechanisms that could potentially be effective in the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. Our review of a large body of literature highlights several governance mechanisms that may help firms to cope with COVID-19 crisis. These governance attributes include risk management committees, board diversity, independent directors, foreign investors, institutional ownership, ownership concentration, CEO's dual roles, block ownership, and family ownership. We provide several policy implications after reviewing the corporate governance literature. Our review illustrates that firms may be subject to at least one of the identified governance mechanisms and they may learn how these governance attributes can be effective in the COVID-19 crisis. Our review illustrates that independent risk management committees, institutional ownership, board independence, blockholders, and family ownership are some of the essential and effective governance mechanisms compared to other governance attributes during COVID-19 crisis.",

        "dc:description": "The current controversies raised due to cryptocurrency mining and their hazardous impact on the environment have spurred the need of the current study to investigate whether green markets offset the risk of cryptocurrencies and carbon markets. We took five categories of financial markets, for instance, bonds, stocks, commodities, cryptocurrencies, and carbon markets to measure their tail risk at 5% value-at-risk (VaR). Moreover, we employed the novel technique of conditional autoregressive value-at-risk (CAViaR) along with time-varying parameters vector autoregressions (TVP-VAR) to indicate asymmetries among these financial markets. We found strong intra-class connectedness clusters with little interconnectedness among the markets. Subsequently, the time-varying trends highlighted extreme risk spillovers during the crisis times. Our findings offer valid justifications for policymakers, stakeholders, regulators, investors, and financial market participants.",

Analyzing a sample of 739 non-financial listed firms in 12 MENA countries for the period 2011-2020, we found that the COVID-19 crisis negatively impacted the performance of firms, especially low-performance firms, in most industries, and increased firm risk in general. Moreover, we found that national governance quality plays an important role in mitigating the negative impact of the COVID- 19 crisis on firm operations. Specifically, national governance quality reduces the negative impact of the COVID-19 crisis on firm performance and the positive impact of the crisis on firm risk. The results are consistent with our contention that national governance quality contributes to creating a positive environment for businesses activities and reducing economic shocks.",

        "dc:description": "With the development of Industry 4.0 and the urgency of transitioning to a low-carbon economy, fintech and environmentally friendly financial instruments have been widely employed because they have played a crucial role in restoring investor confidence in the financial services sector since the global financial crisis in 2008. They not only help investors diversify their portfolios to hedge against risks and enhance returns, but they also help to reduce the negative impacts of climate change. In this study, we analyze the connections among financial technology stocks, green financial assets, and energy markets using nonparametric causality-in-quantile and cross-quantilogram approaches based on the financial contagion theory. We explore whether the performance of fintech prices across booms and busts affects the prices of eco-friendly assets and energy market prices. Our results indicate that in the short run, fintech is highly directionally predictable in all markets except that of green bonds in the lower quantile. Additionally, in the bullish state, the predictability of all lag lengths is negative. Thus, price movements in fintech markets contribute to the vulnerability of the price levels of renewable and non-renewable energy stocks, green bonds, green equities, and sustainable development. Because financial contagion is closely related to asset pricing, portfolio allocation, risk measurement, and monetary policy, the findings of this paper will be informative to investors, portfolio managers, and policy makers.",

        "dc:description": "Recently, the theme of the “green transition”, in which the economic and commercial prospects of the hydrogen industry play a leading role, in the global energy industry has attracted special attention from business, government and scientific circles in many countries, which is associated with its predicted impact, incl. due to the climate agenda, to the economic, technological and geopolitical redistribution of the energy map of the world at the global and regional levels. Some slowdown in the “green transition” is expected due to the need to overcome the global energy crisis in the next two or three years, which may turn out to be more serious than the crisis of the 1970s of the last century which will require eliminating the shortage of traditional non-renewable energy resources in the near future. Nevertheless, the “green transition”, in which hydrogen accents are intensifying, continues to be implemented, which will have a serious impact on the system of international and international economic relations in the world. Thanks to the financial support of the state and business, modern technologies of the entire hydrogen energy chain are actively developing, hydrogen markets are being formed in the conditions of inter-fuel competition, as well as hydrogen energy command centers at the global, regional, country and corporate levels.",

        "dc:description": "This paper analyses the volatility transmission between European Global Systemically Important Banks (GSIBs) and implied stock market volatility. A Dynamic Conditional Correlation Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity model is applied to determine the dynamic correlation between returns of Europe’s GSIBs and the world’s most prominent measure of market “fear”, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX). The results identify a higher negative co-relationship between the VIX and GSIB returns during the COVID-19 period compared with the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), with one-day lagged changes in the VIX negatively Granger-causing bank returns. The asymmetric impact of changes in implied volatility is examined by quantile regressions, with the findings showing that in the lower quartile–where extreme negative bank returns are present–jumps in the VIX are highly significant. This effect is more pronounced during COVID-19 than during the GFC. Additional robustness analysis shows that these findings are consistent during the periods of the Swine Flu and Zika virus epidemics.",

        "dc:description": "Despite controversy over the meaning of financialization, there are two major dimensions to understanding whether the city is financialized. This paper explores these dimensions in China, namely whether the Chinese city (increasingly) uses financial instruments to carry out its urban development tasks and whether the utilization of financial instruments imposes a financial logic on urban governance. Financing the Chinese city involves creating land collateral and financial vehicles, extending shadow banking, formalizing and securitizing local government debts, and “deleveraging” developers’ debts through urban redevelopment. Applying land instruments leads to financial securitization, showing a financial logic in operation. However, financializing the Chinese city is engineered by the state through its credit expansion to cope with the Global Financial Crisis and the ramifications of the entrepreneurial model of the “export-oriented world factory.” It is a state-led financial turn, in which the financial logic is imperative but may not occupy a central position.",

In recent days, this crisis has worsened due to the outbreak of the highly contagious COVID-19 pandemic. To avoid building up stockpiles and contaminating communities with potentially contagious medical waste (MW), and to ensure sustainability in the current and post-COVID-19 era, it is a dire need to develop and implement a safe and efficient medical waste management (MWM) system. This research, thereby, aims to identify, assess, and prioritize the key challenges to efficient and sustainable MWM to mitigate the impacts of the disruptions caused by situations like the pandemic in emerging economies. An integrated approach consisting of the Best-Worst Method (BWM), Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM), and Cross-Impact Matrix Multiplication Applied to Classification (MICMAC) has been proposed to achieve the objectives. Based on the literature review and expert feedback, a total of seventeen challenges were identified and later prioritized by using BWM. The top twelve challenges have been further analyzed using ISM-MICMAC to examine their interrelationships. This study reveals that lack of proper law enforcement and insufficient financial support from investors and the government are two crucial challenges for efficient MWM implementation. The research insights can assist healthcare facility administrators, practitioners, and city managers in identifying the associated challenges and shaping strategic decisions for establishing and managing efficient MWM systems to ensure sustainable development in the post-COVID-19 era.",

Using firms’ environmental and social (E&S) performance to proxy for social capital, we find no relation between social capital and bond spreads over the period 2006–2019. However, during the 2008–2009 financial crisis, which represents a shock to trust and default risk, high-social-capital firms benefited from lower bond spreads. These effects are stronger for firms with higher expected agency costs of debt and firms whose E&S efforts are more salient. During the crisis, high-social-capital firms were also able to raise more debt, at lower spreads, and for longer maturities. We find no evidence that the governance element of ESG is related to bond spreads. The gap between E&S performance of firms in the bottom and top E&S terciles has narrowed since the financial crisis, especially in the year prior to accessing the bond market.",

        "dc:description": "This study examines the relationship of extreme downside risk in various energy markets, including electricity, clean/conventional energy, and carbon markets during several episodes of market turmoil (i.e., Global Financial Crisis, Shale oil revolution, COVID-19 outbreak and the Russian-Ukrainian war). The analysis combines the CAViaR and TVP-VAR techniques, covering the period from August 2005 to May 2023. The results reveal significant interdependencies between electricity and clean energy markets during times of market turmoil. Moreover, the study identifies the transmission of extreme downside risks in periods of crisis. Additionally, we find that including carbon and conventional energy assets in a portfolio with electricity and clean energy can offer diversification benefits. The analysis of net downside risk transmission shows that the crude oil market acts as a net receiver of shocks, while the alternative electricity market functions as a transmitter. Investors and policymakers can leverage these findings to develop appropriate measures that mitigate the adverse effects of extreme downside risk spillovers in different crises.",

SRI are evaluated on the basis of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria. ESG information allows investors to assess the risks associated with a particular firm and how the firm manages or intends to manage future risks. Amidst the increasing investor interest in ESG products, we attempt to study the value addition of ESG performance to investors during crisis period. Using a sample of ESG rated firms listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), we examine the investment performance, trading volumes and return volatility of ESG stocks in an emerging market like India during the COVID-19 crisis. The results of our event study conducted around the important events that have occurred in India during the COVID-19 pandemic provide evidence that investors can use ESG information as a signal of future stock performance. Most importantly, ESG performance provides downside protection during crisis times. Our results show that ESG performance does not prove to be detrimental to investment performance during normal times. Also, ESG performance was found to reduce stock return volatility during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, our study attempts to establish an investment case for ESG stocks in emerging markets in India by providing support to the good management hypothesis.",

        "dc:description": "Introduction Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) have become a serious public health problem. Despite the fact that implementing evidence-based infection control strategies could prevent HAIs and save billions of dollars, Ethiopia lacks national surveillance studies on the rate, economic, and clinical burden of HAIs. Objective To assess the clinical and economic burden of HAIs in hospitalized patients at Ayder comprehensive specialized hospital. Materials and methods A prospective cohort study design was conducted in patients with and without HAIs. A review of medical records, interviews, and patient bills was used to extract necessary information. The patients in the two arms were matched based on age, sex, Charlson comorbidity index, and ward type. Measurable factors were compared between infected and uninfected patients using the paired ttest or McNemar’s test, as appropriate. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of in-hospital mortality. Stata 14.1 was used to conduct all analyses. Results A total of 408 patients, 204 with HAIs and 204 without HAIs were included in the study. In-hospital mortality was higher in patients with HAI (14.7% vs 7.8%, P = 0.028). Patients with HAI stayed an average of 8.3 days longer than controls (18.85 vs 10.59, P<0.001). The average direct medical costs for patients with HAI were 3033 Ethiopian birrs (ETB) higher than controls (4826 vs 1793, P<0.001). The presence of HAIs (AOR: 2.22, 95% CI: 1.13–4.39) and admission to intensive care units (AOR: 3.39, 95% CI: 1.55–7.40) were significant predictors of in-hospital mortality. Conclusion HAIs have a significant impact on in-hospital mortality, the length of extra hospital stays, and extra costs for medical care. Patients admitted to intensive care units and those with HAIs were found to be significant predictors of in-hospital mortality. Interventions must be implemented to prevent HAIs, especially in patients admitted to intensive care units.",

        "dc:description": "There has been an increased usage and popularity of digital platforms during the COVID-19 crisis. This has resulted in many new types of digital platforms emerging that are tied to specific localities and based on emergent needs. This article presents the results of a study on the ClickforVic digital platform that was started during the first 2020 lockdown in Melbourne, Australia as a way for country farmers to connect with urban consumers. The study is premised on transformational entrepreneurship theory that enables a focus on the societal changes that have resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic. A semi-structured in-depth interview approach was utilised to understand how farm entrepreneurs perceived the digital platform and how this contributed to transformational entrepreneurship outcomes. The study is amongst the first to incorporate a digital platform, farm entrepreneurship, transformational entrepreneurship and COVID-19 perspective. The findings suggest that farm entrepreneurs are driven by financial, social and community goals during a crisis that influences their usage of digital platforms. As a consequence, the findings contribute to managerial practice and policy debate by highlighting the way digital platforms can be used in times of crisis to produce transformational entrepreneurship outcomes.",

        "dc:description": "In the context of the “double carbon” target, the issue of corporate greenwashing in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) disclosures has become more prominent as ESG reports spring up. Subsequently, this study examines the relationship between financial report comment letters and greenwashing in companies' ESG disclosures using OLS regression on A-share-listed companies. We found that greenwashing in companies' ESG disclosures increased after they received financial report comment letters. The higher the number of financial report comment letters and the total number of words, the higher the intensity of the comment letter regulation and the greater the greenwashing in companies' ESG disclosures, which verifies the crisis management hypothesis. Simultaneously, greenwashing in ESG disclosures is mainly carried out by companies through “talk more and work less” and “tone management.” Further analysis revealed that financial pressure can increase greenwashing in ESG disclosures in response to comment letters, and improvements in internal and external governance environments can reduce greenwashing in ESG disclosures owing to the receipt of comment letters. Our findings provide a new perspective for understanding greenwashing in ESG disclosures from the insights of financial report comment letters and have important reference value for preventing ESG greenwashing risk and promoting high-quality economic development.",

        "dc:description": "In this study, we investigate the connection between climate change and the volatility of fossil fuel prices using the GARCH-MIDAS framework which accommodates mixed data frequencies and by extension circumvents information loss due to splicing or aggregation of one variable for the other. We conduct a battery of robustness tests that allow for nominal and real prices of fossil fuels as well as global financial crises (GFC). We show a strong connection between climate change and the volatility of fossil fuel prices albeit with stronger evidence in the post-GFC period. The outcome is positive in the recent period and therefore climate change seems to have heightened the volatility in the fossil fuel market. Even when the real prices are considered, results remain consistent, indicating that inflationary pressures do not diminish the effect of climate change on fossil fuel price volatility. We also show that own market risk positively impacts the volatility of fossil fuel prices and the volatility tends to persist when there is a shock to the fossil fuel market. More conscious efforts are needed to effectively discourage increased investments in environmentally-degrading assets.",

We adopt the DS-ARDL and Cross-Quantilogram approaches to examine the effect of higher energy prices on commodity currencies during this war. Our findings based on 4-h time frame data between January and November 2022 indicate a significant positive effect of energy price hikes on the value of the Australian dollar relative to the Japanese yen, Euro, and British pound. The comparison of the effects of gas and oil price hikes on the exchange rates reveals that these exchange rate movements have been mostly due to gas price shocks. Considering the effects of this war on the international economy, the most critical policy implications to improve the financial health of the economies are provided.",

        "dc:description": "Since the global economic crisis, researchers and policymakers have paid close attention to the carbon emissions and financial development interrelationship, and some researchers believe that financial development can aid in abating the emissions of carbon. Thus, the objective of this study is to analysis the impacts of financial development of the MINT countries (Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria and Turkey) on their CO2 emissions year on year via historical data covering the period 1969–2019. The full-sample bootstrap non-Granger causality test outcomes for Mexico and Turkey reveal that there is a one-way causal association from financial development to CO2 emissions. Short and long-run instability is shown through a range of parameter constancy tests utilized to investigate the stability of the estimated vector autoregressive models. This implies that the full-sample causality tests are inadequate, necessitating the use of a time-varying (bootstrap) rolling-window technique to address parameter non-constancy and prevent pre-test distortion; therefore, this research uses rolling-window bootstrap estimation. Empirical results from the rolling-window bootstrap estimation show that the nexus between financial development and carbon emissions is date-stamped. These outcomes indicate that significant feedback causal associations exist between financial development and CO2 emissions in sub-sampled periods in the MINT nations. In addition, we observe emission-decreasing and emission-increasing effects of financial development in the sampled countries across period. One of the study policy recommendations is that policymakers in these nations through monetary authority should mop-up financial resources from institutions showing emission-increasing tendencies to institutions and/or sectors with emission-reducing tendencies.",

        "dc:description": "The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on both the financial market and the real economy, leading to widespread concern about the relationship between environmental, social, and governance (ESG) responsibilities and shareholders' wealth. This paper examines the relationship between ESG responsibility and stock returns in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and investigates the impact of ESG responsibility on stock price resilience. The results indicate that corporate ESG scores have positive impacts on stock returns during and after the COVID-19 crisis, with the positive impacts of ESG being more significant in the post-crisis period. Among the different ESG dimensions, environmental responsibility (ESG_E) has a more significant impact on stock returns, while social responsibility (ESG_S) and governance responsibility (ESG_G) have mixed impacts during the crisis. Furthermore, during and after the outbreak of COVID-19, the positive impacts of ESG are more pronounced among firms located in low-trust regions and firms with lower analyst coverage. Additionally, the study finds that corporate ESG responsibility help restore the resilience of stock prices during the crisis, with better ESG performance leading to stronger stock price resilience. Overall, the results strongly support the conclusion that ESG has acted as an “equity vaccine” during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

The Parasite Stress Theory of Values suggests that such pandemic crises have detrimental impacts on entrepreneurial activity due to social distancing and its effects on interaction, collaboration, and innovation. However, alternatives to personal contact now available thanks to digitalization, have not yet been examined. We expect entrepreneurial firms with more digitalized business models to show higher resilience to pandemic crises, especially those highly affected by globalization and more for non-family businesses than for family businesses. Based on a survey of German Mittelstand firms in the midst of the crisis induced by COVID-19, our findings broadly support our expectations and thus help qualify the Parasite Stress Theory of Values and contribute to a better understanding of organizational resilience in times of pandemic crises.",

Findings reveal the positive improvement from institutional investors, and this impact is stronger in firms with better-expected ESG performance and low initial ESG performance. Besides, heterogeneous institutional investors have different influences, and only a pressure-resistant institution plays the promotion role. Further studies based on the period following the financial crisis and when emphasising the environmental protection policy reveal that financial motivation and reputation motivation could be the reason for institutional holding. Our findings are robust after using the instrumental variable analysis, controlling for firm fixed effects, and replacing institutional holdings, and could be beneficial for the governance of firms in China.",

        "dc:description": "This chapter analyzes the process of global population aging, which has a significant impact on all areas of public life in the twenty-first century. Already today, in almost two dozen countries of the world, 20% of the population is over 65 years old. According to the WHO, the 60+ age group in the world already exceeds the number of children under 5 years of age. At the same time, by 2050 the number of 65+ will exceed the number of adolescents and young people aged 15–24. The influence of the population aging process on various areas of social activity will be determined by its scale and depth, i.e. by the possible demographic structure of the future society. At the same time, the ability of modern society to cope with increasing risks associated with this process is problematic. Among the risks and problems associated with population aging, one finds economic slowdowns, pension crisis, problems of care for the growing numbers of disabled and frail people, maintaining the financial savings of the elderly, the issue of ageism, and the vulnerability of the elderly during periods of crisis and pandemics and consequently maintaining life expectancy as well as a stable democracy and even world order. These risks and problems are of particular concern given that by the mid-twenty-first century, two-thirds of people over 65 will live in middle and low-income countries. Moreover, aging will affect even the currently poorest countries in sub-Saharan Africa with young populations. In view of this, the problem of social security and health care for the elderly is becoming increasingly acute and requires the adoption of proactive measures. The problem of population aging is given insufficient attention by such international organizations as the UN and WHO; in general, studies of this issue are limited in the public sphere as well as in scientific discourse. However, even now the, global aging is an extremely important problem and, we suppose, it will become the most crucial problem in the future. So, insufficient attention to it is threatening societal tensions, crisis, and intergenerational conflicts as well as political and social instability. In the present chapter, we approach this process from the point of view of the transition from perceiving it as a problem to considering it as providing new opportunities associated with the presence of worldly wisdom and experience in a more mature and older generation. Today, concrete measures must be taken in different spheres, and special long-term programs must be adopted to create a higher health-related quality of life (HRQoL) for the older generation and to combat the widespread stereotype of the end of life and the feeling of doom. Grinin et al. point out the importance of technologies, the development of which can be stimulated precisely by the process of global aging and the need to increase life expectancy. As a background for the forthcoming technological wave (which we denote as the Cybernetic Revolution), global aging may create an acute demand for labor-saving technologies, as well as give a powerful impulse in the field of medicine. Progress in the latter will help to extend the working age and improve health-related (biological) quality of life.",

        "dc:description": "Financial markets are often at the mercy of diverse crises at the country-specific, regional, or global levels. However, these crises may impose different impacts on the performance of the financial markets, making investors and policymakers consistently interested in how the markets behave in such periods to be adequately guided in their investment and policy decisions. This study answers this curiosity by examining the multifractality and cross-correlation between oil prices and prominent European and non-European stock markets before and during the recent Russia-Ukraine war. Our empirical analysis detects a strong multifractal behaviour in the oil and stock markets. However, persistence is generally higher at the lower scales, representing the sampled periods' beginning. Moreover, the war has a stronger direct influence on the persistence of the oil and the European stock markets. In contrast, it has a stronger indirect impact on the persistence of the stock markets of non-European countries through oil prices. These countries, namely the U.S., Japan, and China, have the largest economies in the world. Nonetheless, the impact of oil prices was stronger for all the countries in the war period, as their stock markets became inefficient.",

Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from a sample of 124 conventional and Islamic banks in Indonesia from 2004 to 2018. The two-step generalized methods of moments was used to estimate the system model. Findings: This study finds that FinTech startups have a detrimental effect on bank performance. This study also finds that Islamic banks have low performance compared to conventional banks. However, when FinTech startups interact with Islamic banks, this paper discovers that a greater number of FinTech startups have a positive effect on the performance of Islamic banks, particularly the peer-to-peer lending category. Additionally, this paper finds that FinTech startups improve Islamic banks' performance in both normal and crisis periods. Practical implications: This paper provides recommendations for Islamic bank management and supervisors to deal with FinTech startups during normal and crisis periods by collaborating with FinTech startups and being willing to adopt cutting-edge financial technology applications. Originality/value: This paper provides evidence of the impact of FinTech on the performance of Islamic banks, specifically on peer-to-peer lending and payment startup during the crisis and normal periods.",

        "dc:description": "Purpose: Micro, small and medium enterprise (MSME) is the kingpin of Indian economy. It contributes to 48% of India's exports and provides employment to 110 million people. As a result, it is critical to evaluate the obstacles, expose them and find a way to overcome the crisis due to the pandemic. The study aims to analyse the impact of financial and non-financial measures for the revival of MSME and its impact on firm sustainability and future opportunity as perceived by MSME owners/heads during the COVID-19 outbreak. Design/methodology/approach: This study, based on a cross-sectional survey of 197 export-oriented Indian MSMEs, attempts to investigate covid crisis mitigation strategies/measures in the context of the COVID-19 crisis. The confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) model was applied to check model fit, and structural equation modelling (SEM) was employed for data analysis. Findings: The results of this study show the financial and non-financial revival measures such as firm revival, marketing training, customer relationship management (CRM), financial incentive and firm support, extending worker social security and financial access and price control positively impact MSMEs' business sustainability and future opportunity as perceived by the respondents that lent good support to the hypothesis. Research limitations/implications: The study emphasizes management in association with government and financial institutions to design short-term as well as long-term strategies that may enhance their sustainability in the market. MSMEs are being forced to reassess their business strategy and modify their operating model as a result of the uncertain/unpredictable climate. Many levels of strategy aid in revitalizing the company and providing future possibilities to move forward if the government schemes positively impact the perception of entrepreneurs. Further, the study identifies the immediate measures to tide over the crisis over this sector and then furnishes recommendations for closing the identified gaps in the present understanding. Originality/value: The impact of COVID-19 on Indian MSMEs and how these MSMEs are dealing with it are highlighted in this paper, which is quite scarce and insufficient to cover the gap.

        "dc:description": "Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) research has grown in importance in today's highly volatile and interconnected economy. This work investigates the relationship between EPU and Financial Stability (FS) (i.e., Z-scores and non-performing loans (NPL)) with the mediating variable of governance quality through a 23-country panel data from 2005 to 2019. The System Generalized Method of Moment (SYS-GMM) is adopted to address the issue of endogeneity, which is common in panel data regression. The two-stage Sequential of the Linear Panel Data Model (SELPDM) was also used to test the robustness of the results. According to the findings, EPU has a significant negative effect on financial stability (measured by the Z-score) and a significant positive effect on financial stability in the banking industry of most developed economies (proxied by NPL). We also discovered that good governance can be used to mitigate the negative effects of EPU on financial stability; however, this influence varies depending on region, bank, and market structure, and it was significantly greater during the global financial crisis. Finally, this study can help financial managers and policymakers develop appropriate policies to understand how banks respond to EPU.",

Our sample period ranges from May 1, 2009, to March 1, 2022, covering the aftermath of global financial crisis, subsequent boom and bust of oil markets and the COVID-19 pandemic. We document a sizable connectedness of oil price shocks with fixed income asset classes. We document oil demand and risk shocks' role as main transmitters of spillover. Our findings have important implications for investors, policy makers and regulators.",

        "dc:description": "Although there has not been a large-scale systemic crisis in China, high-risk financial events have occurred continuously in recent years. This research thus creatively analyzes the determinants of systemic risk for Chinese financial institutions from the view of asset price bubbles. First, we identify bubbles in the China stock and real estate markets on the basis of the generalized sup Augmented Dickey-Fuller (GSADF) model and explain the reasons for bubble formations according to the stage of China's economic development and policies implementation. At this stage, considering the differences in economic development levels of different cities, the real estate bubbles in the first, second and third tier cities and the whole country were innovatively identified. Second, on the basis of the DCG-GARCH-CoVaR model to measure the systemic risk of listed financial institutions in China and to classify institutions, the results show that the main source of such risk is the banking sector. Furthermore, by constructing regression models, stock market bubbles and real estate bubbles both positively correlate with systemic risk throughout the sample period. Meanwhile, the impact of bubbles on the systemic risk of different types of financial institutions was taken into account so that regulators prioritized different types of institutions with different characteristics when faced with decisions. Finally, we provide macro-prudential policy advice to regulators in order to weaken the impact of bubbles on financial stability to avoid systemic crises.",

        "dc:description": "Green bonds are becoming increasingly important in sustainable investments since their environmental protection attributes allow them to benefit from environmental degradation. However, the mechanism of environmental degradation on green bonds has not yet been studied. This study proposes a mediation model to analyze air pollution's influence on green bonds. Theoretically, air pollution leads to increased public concern through public environmental awareness and perceptions of physical health risks. Enhanced public concern drives investors' green preference and environmental responsibility, thus expanding green bond demand, in which public concern plays an important mediation role. To verify the mediating effect, causal stepwise regression and bootstrap methods are used. The empirical results confirm this theoretical mechanism. Air pollution is significantly positively related to public concern. Public concern is positively linked with green bond investment willingness, resulting in increased volatility. The total positive effect of air pollution on green bonds is partly absorbed by the mediating effect of public concern that is significantly positive and reaches 30.21% of the total effect. In addition, major crisis events (e.g., COVID-19) may hinder the positive mediation process by generating a negative trend and distracting the public. This means that the government could propose appropriate measures to minimize the negative aspects in order to promote green finance. The mediation model is also useful for investors wishing to increase green assets in their portfolios and provides an incentive for businesses to promote green finance.",

It uses an analytical classification of African economies, with each being fragile, factor-driven or investment-driven. It also accounts for interaction effects and the problem of cross-sectional dependence that previous studies overlooked. While the long-run effect of FDI on growth is significantly positive in investment- and factor-driven economies, its short-run effect is insignificant in the latter type of economies. The effect of FDI on growth is insignificant in the fragile category both in the short-run and long-run, however.",

We examine the directional predictability from two climate risk measures, transition risk and physical risk, to the returns and volatility of European brown and green energy stocks, European carbon emission allowances, and global green bonds. Using daily data, we apply a cross-quantilogram approach in a time-varying setting to measure potential differences in the predictability across quantiles and over various crisis periods. The return predictability results are more pronounced for transition risk than physical risk, especially for brown energy stocks and carbon emission allowances, and they generally vary across periods and markets conditions. The predictability of volatility is also significant at specific time periods and volatility states, especially from transition risk, and the sign of the predictability is positive for brown energy and carbon emission allowances whereas it is negative for green bonds. We show that a lower-than-expected level of discussion about the transition process leads to a heightened volatility of brown energy markets. These findings have important implications regarding climate risks assessment on return and volatility predictability and climate risk and portfolio decarbonization under COP26.",

        "dc:description": "In all areas of knowledge, research has shown the devastating effects of COVID-19, and the impact on families’ financial stress and well-being is one of them. Crises are predictors of families’ financial stress as they produce changes in their income and negative feelings, such as fear and demotivation, which affect well-being. This study analyses the financial and social impact of COVID-19 on families, supported by the ABCE-WB model, with data collection being the result of snowball sampling. The results obtained allow the conclusion that the current pandemic crisis has caused financial stress in families, to a greater or lesser degree, and caused feelings of fear and demotivation as consequences of the general lockdown. The empirical evidence also shows that these effects are positively associated with the perception of their level of well-being. The contribution of the study lies in corroborating the model used. Final considerations are presented together with the limitations and suggestions for future research.",

The research employs a novel framework that combines the CAViaR model with the TVP-VAR based connectedness approach to analyze the systematic tail risk transmission mechanisms. The study covers a period from January 2, 2018, to January 25, 2023, and reveals that Solar and WILDERHILL clean energy markets had the highest risk levels. Conversely, clean energy cryptocurrencies like GARID, POWR, and SNC demonstrated stable tail risk over time, offering diversification benefits, particularly in relation to energy metals and fossil fuels. The study identified strong intra-class connectedness clusters and highlighted extreme risk spillovers during crisis periods through time-varying trends. Several implications for policymakers, investors, and financial market participants are suggested.",

        "dc:description": "The expanding petrochemical industry depends on fossil fuels both as feedstock and a source of energy and is at the heart of the intertwined global crises relating to plastics, climate, and toxic emissions. Addressing these crises requires uprooting the deep-seated lock-ins that sustain petrochemical plastics. This perspective identifies lock-ins that stand in the way of ambitious emission reductions and ending plastic pollution. We emphasize that addressing the growing plastic production and consumption requires confronting the political economy of petrochemicals. We put forward key elements needed to address the dual challenges of moving away from the unsustainable production of plastics and drastically reducing emissions from the petrochemical sector and argue for attention to the links between fossil fuels and plastics, which in turn involves challenging entrenched power structures and vested interests linked to the fossil-based plastics economy. A critical step would be ensuring attention to the production of petrochemicals and related upstream issues in the upcoming global plastics treaty.",

        "dc:description": "During the pandemic, all countries of the world were affected by a health pandemic was the largest in the twenty-first century, which affected the performance of companies and put them in a difficult situation with the escalation of uncertainty. Our study evaluates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on firms' financial performance and the moderating role of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance in this relationship. Based on a large international panel dataset that includes nine countries from G20 extracted from the Thomson Reuters EIKON database for the period from 2016 to 2021, a set of statistical analyses was applied, including descriptive statistics, correlation matrix, fixed effect regression, and robust regression using GMM model. The findings indicate that the pandemic negatively affected financial performance significantly, while the performance of ESG limits this effect. Thus, companies engaged in ESG activities are the least affected during the pandemic. Fulfilling stakeholders' demands enhances companies' performance during crises and corporate directors' resort to maintaining the performance of ESG as one of the effective strategies during the crisis to reduce the impact of COVID-19 on financial performance. This study shows that compliance with ESG issues can mitigate negative financial impacts during crises and that while implementing ESG practices is costly, it satisfies stakeholders and generates financial gains for companies. Theoretically, we directed the theoretical lens to research through crisis and stakeholder theories to explain events.",

This research aims to explore the effect of economic complexity and financial risk on the load capacity factor. The research employed a series of second-generation techniques such as a method of moment quantile regression and Dumitrescu Hurlin panel causality covering the period between 1990 and 2018. The findings provided convincing evidence of cointegration. The long-run analysis showed that renewable energy use, economic complexity and financial risk contribute to ecological quality. However, non-renewable energy and economic progress threaten ecological quality by lessening the load capacity factor. The research revealed causality from financial risk, economic growth, disintegrated energy and economic complexity to load capacity factor. Lastly, a policy framework is proposed based on the study findings to accomplish the sustainable development goals (SDGs) 7, 13 and 17.",

This article explains how housing financialization was reignited in Spain following key policy reforms in 2013. We argue that Spanish authorities managed to strategically recreate a finance-friendly environment to attract global investors. They combined financial policies, other deregulatory reforms and neoliberal measures in a coordinated manner we call a policy package. Our analysis provides evidence of the legal and political arrangements at various state levels that effectively facilitated the reanimation of a new cycle of housing financialization which caused rising inflation in prices and distress in tenants’ rights. This approach contributes to the understanding of how state-led actions foster a spatial fix to overcome financial crises by granting global speculative funds extraordinary benefits. In addition, we show how this process occurred with poor democratic accountability and was also confronted by various forms of social contestation.",

        "dc:description": "In this incisive fifth edition of Financial Crises and Recession in the Global Economy, Roy E. Allen examines the major financial instabilities, crises, and evolutionary trends since the 1970s and through the recent Covid-19 pandemic. Providing empirical research on the relation between money and the real economy, Allen explains how key financial variables are driven more by psychological and social constructs than is commonly understood and discusses how monetary wealth transfers in the context of what he terms 'US money mercantilism' have favored the US dollar 'core' of the global system. Chapters go on to explore the continuing globalization of financial markets, including further innovations in information-processing technology, government deregulation, new uses and forms of money, and emerging financial products and markets. Allen elaborates on the political economy of financial crises and further advances his human ecology economics framework to help guide research and policymaking in the future. Explaining why large-scale financial instabilities occur and how they might be better managed and avoided, this thoroughly revised fifth edition will be an essential resource for students and scholars of international economics, macroeconomics, international finance, and international political economy. Its critical insights on how the international system continues to evolve will also help inform policymakers' responses to financial crises.",

        "dc:description": "Despite their population, Asian countries have failed to provide full economic recovery, and what recovery has occurred may be short-lived if they do not protect the environment. Asian nations' economic recovery from the Asian Financial crisis (1997–1998) is examined in this study, with a focus on the consequences of globalization, economic growth, financial development, natural resource utilization and innovation. Econometric approaches that can handle cross-sectionally dependent panel datasets are used to determine the environmental implications of these variables over the period 1980 to 2016. This work uses the second-generation panel unit root and long-run cointegration tests for robust and reliable results. There is a mixed order of integration for the variables, which are cointegrated. The long-term regressions show increased economic recovery due to natural resource use, while technological advancement reduces economic recovery. The results suggest that financial development and eco-innovation enhance economic recovery, whereas urbanization accelerates environmental deterioration by increasing the ecological footprint. This study recommends that Asian countries become more financially incorporated, fund environmental initiatives, support environmental modernization and accelerate economic recovery rates through their energy production and consumption.",

        "dc:description": "The paper aims to investigate the effects of corporate social performance (CSP) on bankruptcy likelihood in times of economic upswing. This is important because prior related literature focused on data containing times of economic crises. We measure bankruptcy likelihood with the Altman Z score and CSP with Refinitiv ESG scores. By applying static panel data regressions and instrumental variable regressions on a sample of 6696 US-firm-year observations from 2010 to 2019 our main findings are: (i) In contrast to existing research, the level of firms’ CSP seems to have no (positive) effect on the likelihood of bankruptcy during times of economic upswing. (ii) Increasing a firm’s CSP in times of economic upswing leads to a rise in bankruptcy likelihood. We conclude that the positive effects of CSP on stakeholder relationships fail to materialize in flourishing business environments. The costs of increasing CSP, thus, exceed their immediate positive effects and raise bankruptcy likelihood. However, as they reduce financial default risk in subsequent crises, CSP investments can be seen as a balancing measure. Our findings bear implications for scholars, practitioners, and policymakers.",

It examines flaws in the university system revealed by the COVID-19 pandemic and identifies how the conditions created by neoliberal policies have limited universities' capacity to respond to a crisis. The paper reviews the previous literature on universities, neoliberalism policies, and new public management practices. It uses data from the literature, newspapers, and contemporary documents to shape an overview of the Australian public sector university system up to 2021 and its transformation by stealth. The impact of this transformation has been a heavy reliance on international onshore student fees to fund operations, infrastructure, and research activities. COVID-19-related public health measures have caused a significant downturn in the number of international students studying in Australia, in turn, creating a financial crisis that has seen many tens of thousands of university staff losing their jobs and courses being cut. The transformation has also seen accountingization of both individual academic and university performance to become the norm. The quantified performance metrics associated with accountingization have become universities' new language, and their goal displaced ends. Revenue generation and expenditure has been privileged over making a contribution to the nation and society. We call for a radical rethinking of the public sector university mission for the ultimate benefit of the Australian community.",

A new measure of social responsibility by Thomson Reuters, called the ESG Combined Score, is used. As a novel feature of our analysis, socially responsible engagement is divided into the strategic activities closely related to the examined companies’ core business and the remaining secondary activities. The results of the fixed effects regression show a positive and statistically, as well as economically, significant impact of the strategic activities on the corporate stock market performance of companies. This impact is up to 103% higher compared to the secondary activities. The empirical results suggest that if companies aim to increase their share prices via the corporate social responsibility channel, they should strategically select their socially responsible initiatives.",

        "dc:description": "This Viewpoint brings together insights from health system experts working in a range of settings. Our focus is on examining the state of the resilience field, including current thinking on definitions, conceptualisation, critiques, measurement, and capabilities. We highlight the analytical value of resilience, but also its risks, which include neglect of equity and of who is bearing the costs of resilience strategies. Resilience depends crucially on relationships between system actors and components, and—as amply shown during the COVID-19 pandemic—relationships with wider systems (eg, economic, political, and global governance structures). Resilience is therefore connected to power imbalances, which need to be addressed to enact the transformative strategies that are important in dealing with more persistent shocks and stressors, such as climate change. We discourage the framing of resilience as an outcome that can be measured; instead, we see it emerge from systemic resources and interactions, which have effects that can be measured. We propose a more complex categorisation of shocks than the common binary one of acute versus chronic, and outline some of the implications of this for resilience strategies. We encourage a shift in thinking from capacities towards capabilities—what actors could do in future with the necessary transformative strategies, which will need to encompass global, national, and local change. Finally, we highlight lessons emerging in relation to preparing for the next crisis, particularly in clarifying roles and avoiding fragmented governance.",

        "dc:description": "Complexities of crises force supply chains managers to formulate crisis-induced strategies, which contrast with the conventional strategies that give precedence to competitive priorities. Recent crises, such as the coronavirus outbreaks, large-scale product recalls, and financial crises, underscore the increasing regularity and severity of crises with imperatives for introspective and retrospective socio-economic insights on the contexts, priorities, and themes of supply chain management in times of crisis. The purpose of this article is to review the literature on supply chain management in times of crisis, systematically coalescing the related body of scholarly work; outlining current methods applied by researchers; capturing strategic priorities and themes of complexities in research studies; and highlighting potentials for future studies. Using a systematic review of 250 journal articles published between 1996 and 2021, the review finds four dimensions for restorative priorities that reflect operations strategy during crisis: (i) critical supplies with essential services, (ii) timely response with recovery, (iii) safety with security, and (iv) traceability with transparency. The review also finds that operational complexities during crises originate from network configurations and business cycle complexities, optimal selections and provisioning system complexes, and complex learning processes and demand predictions. Insights from the review aid in the proposal of build-to-cycle, organic capabilities, and operational mindfulness framings for supply chain management in times of crisis. The article concludes by recommending future research studies on supply chain upgrades, diagnosis, solidarity, mapping, temporariness, and thresholds, as well as optimal selection problems on linking crisis systems investments with liabilities and on linking crisis network allotments with cross-functionalities.",

The results show that on mid-term and long-term scales, the dependence relationships between the oil and green stock markets are tighter while lead-lag patterns are mixed and time-varying. Total risk spillovers between the oil and green stock markets are mostly conveyed over time. Risk spillovers from the oil market are substantially larger in the green stock market. Furthermore, global crises such as the Great Recession, the oil price collapse, and the COVID-19 pandemic have substantially amplified the magnitude of risk spillovers. Overall, the green stock market has not yet developed enough potential for a larger independence from the conventional energy market. Hence, for participants in the energy and financial markets who have different time horizons for asset allocation and risk management and for committed investors in particular, the examination of time-frequency dependence and risk spillovers can be quite beneficial.",

        "dc:description": "Traditionally, economic growth and business cycles have been treated independently. However, the dependence of GDP levels on its history of shocks, what economists refer to as “hysteresis,” argues for unifying the analysis of growth and cycles. In this paper, we review the recent empirical and theoretical literature that motivates this paradigm shift. The renewed interest in hysteresis (or “scarring” in recent parlance) has been sparked by the persistent impact of the global financial crisis—as GDP in advanced economies remained far below the precrisis trends for over a decade—and recent concerns about the lasting impact of the COVID-19 shock. The findings of the recent literature have far-reaching conceptual and policy implications. In recessions, monetary and fiscal policies need to be more active to avoid the permanent scars of a downturn. And in good times, running a high-pressure economy could have permanent positive effects.",

        "dc:description": "This paper employs the Tail Event NETwork (TENET) to identify financial markets with greater potential risk, and simultaneously investigate the interdependence between them. We find strong time-varying connectedness across 23 emerging markets during the main crisis episodes, including the most recent COVID-19 pandemic, using data from January 1995 to May 2021. The network analysis revealed that emerging European markets are top risk transmitters, whereas emerging Asian markets are top risk receivers. China showed disconnection from the network, reflecting its diversification potential for investors. Our findings offer several policy and regulatory implications.",

Design/methodology/approach: The authors use a global sample of listed firms in the tourism industry in 30 countries from 2015 to 2020. Findings: First, firm performance is positively associated with the proportion of female directors on a board. Second, the positive association between firm performance and the proportion of female directors on the board is higher in (1) countries with stronger shareholder rights, (2) countries with stronger securities law regulation stipulating disclosure of board diversity, (3) countries with stronger economic empowerment of women, and (4) during the COVID-19 crisis. Third, corporate financial distress risk is lower in firms with higher proportion of female directors on the board. Fourth, the negative association between corporate financial distress risk and the proportion of female directors on the board is more pronounced in (1) countries with stronger securities law regulations stipulating disclosure of board gender diversity, (2) countries with stronger economic empowerment of women, and (3) during the COVID-19 crisis. Originality/value: The results indicate that contextual factors (comprising country-level corporate governance structures, economic empowerment of women and economic crisis) can affect the association between board gender diversity and firm performance.",

        "dc:description": "The integrated renewable energy resources (RERs) based smart grid in the power distribution network (PDN) has financial and ecological benefits. However, the emergence of RER-based microgrids and substations without real-time monitoring of their power parameters leads to various challenges in the PDN, such as suboptimal resource allocation, poor load management, grid instability, and lack of real-time decision-making capabilities. To mitigate these challenges, increase the system's visibility, and make efficient decisions, intelligent monitoring and control system is required for both smart grid and power substation. This proposed study develops IoT-based monitoring and control of power substations and associated distributed smart grids to make effective decisions of integration/segregation into the PDN. The proposed IoT-based integration/segregation of smart grids and load management can mitigate the stated challenges effectively. Using the HOMER Grid®, the research also investigates the annualized power production pattern of smart grids and the power consumption pattern of integrated loads to enable proactive decisions about energy management. The proposed study implements IoT technology for power parameters monitoring of substations and smart grids for their effective use, as it considers four types of load management, including industrial, domestic, commercial, and electric vehicles, with the aid of IoT technology to avoid power fluctuations and contingencies. Effective load management has been adopted based on annualized energy consumption, load patterns and real-time monitoring, and active decisions making. The results highlight that the proposed IoT-based approach helps advance smart grid integration into the PDN and enhance energy load management, consequently reducing energy costs and suppressing carbon emissions. The validation of the proposed model is verified by the constructed prototype, where the achieved real-time monitoring and control of power substations and smart grids into PDN is performed to make effective decisions related to energy and load management. Moreover, it effectively allows power distribution companies to manage loads during high demand or crises and enhances grid stability and energy efficiency.",

The study tested the relationship between the variables using the Kalman approach, Hansen technique and sensitivity analysis using matrix component factors. The findings revealed that wind power energy consumption had increased quickly in past times due to its input nature for biofuel production. However, the capability of onshore and offshore wind power production grew by 7% in COVID-19 with the role of green financing in the wind power sector. Moreover, green financing enhances the demands on wind generators and energy converters' usage and dependability by 26%. For this, a 39% increase in green financing is noticed by the research findings during the COVID-19 crisis period. Such robust study findings present the latest insights that green financing is an eminent and viable source of financing to enhance wind power energy generation. Following these, multiple research implications are also presented for the key stakeholders.",

        "dc:description": "Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to study the market reactions of the banking industry to the Russian–Ukraine war. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses an event study methodology, regression analyses and interaction effects to study the effect of the war on banks stock prices and analyze factors that explain the cumulative abnormal return. Findings: First, this study finds a significant decline of almost 1.5% in return on the war date. Similar patterns were observed for all continents, but Europe had the most severe drop of about 4%. Second, after excluding the contemporaneous influence of the whole market using the market model, global bank equities returns fell by about 1% on the war date, indicating that bank stocks were more severely impacted by the war than the average stock market. Net-of-market return approach further reveals that bank stock prices decreased 1.4% more on the event day compared to the prewar market average. Third, the impacts of the war and sanctions were persistent when the war continued. Banks stocks were most hit in Europe, Asia and North America. Originality/value: This paper pioneers the study of the effect of the Russia–Ukraine war on the banking industry. This paper also analyzes the reaction pattern of bank stocks before, during and after the war to explain the behavior and expectations of investors toward the war.",

        "dc:description": "The international dry bulk shipping market is closely related to the commodity and crude oil markets. At the same time, the Baltic Dry Index (BDI) is usually considered as the main indicator of economic activities. In order to clarify the correlations between the three markets, this paper employs the Copula-VAR-BEKK-GARCH-X model to explore the dynamic dependence and volatility spillovers between the Baltic Dry Index, iron ore price and Brent crude oil price. In addition, the influence of exogenous variables (BDI/Iron ore/Brent) on market volatility and co-volatility is further discussed. The empirical results indicate that: first, the dependence between BDI, iron ore price and Brent crude oil price is time-varying and time-lag, especially when suffering from major crises. Second, dynamic dependencies and volatility spillovers between BDI, iron ore price and Brent crude oil price have significantly strengthened during COVID-19, manifesting that the impact of market turmoil has reinforced the linkages between markets. Third, this paper reaffirms the role of BDI as an intra and inter market indicator, while finding indication that iron ore is beginning to emerge its predictive indicator post-COVID-19. The results are not only conducive to the investment portfolio selection of individual investors and institutional investors, but also beneficial to formulating trade policies or shipping strategies by countries or shipping organizations.",

        "dc:description": "Although social distancing can effectively contain the spread of infectious diseases by reducing social interactions, it may have economic effects. Crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic create dilemmas for policymakers because the long-term implementation of restrictive social distancing policies may cause massive economic damage and ultimately harm healthcare systems. This paper proposes an epidemic control framework that policymakers can use as a data-driven decision support tool for setting efficient social distancing targets. The framework addresses three aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic that are related to social distancing or community mobility data: modeling, financial implications, and policy-making. Thus, we explore the COVID-19 pandemic and concurrent economic situation as functions of historical pandemic data and mobility control. This approach allows us to formulate an efficient social distancing policy as a stochastic feedback control problem that minimizes the aggregated risks of disease transmission and economic volatility. We further demonstrate the use of a deep learning algorithm to solve this control problem. Finally, by applying our framework to U.S. data, we empirically examine the efficiency of the U.S. social distancing policy.",

        "dc:description": "The challenges related to climate policy and the energy crisis caused the search for alternative ways of obtaining energy, one of the essential tasks faced by scientists and political decision-makers. Recently, much attention has been paid to biomethane, which is perceived as a substitute for natural gas. Compared to the traditional combustion of biogas in cogeneration units (CHP), upgrading it to the form of biomethane can bring both environmental benefits (reduction in GHG emissions) and economic benefits (higher efficiency of energy use contained in biomass). The purpose of this review was a comprehensive assessment of the conditions and opportunities for developing the biomethane sector in the EU in the face of challenges generated by the energy and climate crisis. The article reviews the condition of the biomethane market in the European Union, focusing on such issues as biomethane production technologies, current and future supply and demand for biomethane, and biomethane production costs with particular emphasis on upgrading processes and financial support systems used in the EU countries. The review showed that the market situation in biomethane production has recently begun to change rapidly. However, the share of biomethane in meeting the needs for natural gas remains small. Moreover, the available expert studies indicate a significant development potential, which is desirable because of the need to increase energy security and environmental and economic reasons. However, this will require organizing the legal environment and creating a transparent system of incentives.",

        "dc:description": "With the global energy crisis, increasing demand, and a national-level emphasis on electric vehicles (EVs), numerous innovations are being witnessed throughout the EV industry. EVs are equipped with sensors that maintain a sustainable environment for the betterment of society and enhance human sustainability. However, at the same time, as is the case for any new digital technology, they are susceptible to threats to security and privacy. Recent incidents demonstrate that these sensors have been misused for car and energy theft, financial fraud, data compromise, and have caused severe health and safety problems, amongst other things. To the best of our knowledge, this paper provides a first systematic analysis of EV sustainability, digital technologies that enhance sustainability, their potential cybersecurity threats, and corresponding defense. Firstly, three robust taxonomies have been presented to identify the dangers that can affect long-term sustainability domains, including (1) life and well-being, (2) safe environment, and (3) innovation and development. Second, this research measures the impact of cybersecurity threats on EVs and correspondingly to their sustainability goals. Third, it details the extent to which specific security controls can mitigate these threats, thereby allowing for a smooth transition toward secure and sustainable future smart cities.",

        "dc:description": "The COVID-19 crisis and global economic recession have shrunk the world's energy use, collapsed stock markets and crashed energy prices. Green economy projects are hence losing their focus and competitiveness, endangering the achievement of sustainable development goals and neutrality targets. The study aims to examine the dynamic linkages between the green economy, sustainability, Bitcoin, oil prices and stock markets. We do this by utilizing the daily data from August 2016 to August 2021 for the case of the United States. The recently developed quantile-on-quantile regression (QQR) and quantile Granger causality methods are employed for empirical analysis. Our empirical results indicate that a green economy or green financing from institutions is very sensitive to economic shocks, oil price changes and overall sustainability changes. Similarly, empirical results further reveal that there is a negative association between sustainability with oil prices and sustainability with stock markets; that oil prices and stock markets are also sensitive to sustainability-related shifts. Our study advises investors who want to support sustainable development to include green assets in their portfolios, such as green bonds, which are a good substitute for clean energy or renewable energy stocks. This study reports some fruitful implications apropos of sustainable development goals and a green economy.",

To do so, this study employed semi-structured interviews with 30 individuals each with and without prior experience visiting Iran. The findings revealed that sanctions influence affective and cognitive images and enhance tourist risk perceptions, including financial, satisfaction, terrorism and war, political, crime, security, and functional/performance risks. Furthermore, a positive post-trip evaluation was found to play a significant role in further behavioral intention, thereby enhancing destination image. Overall, this study enriches the literature on tourism and crises by focusing on visitors' and non-visitors' perceptions of a sanctioned destination and their subsequent behavioral intents. The theoretical and practical implications of the study are provided in the conclusion.",

        "dc:description": "The increasing concerns of investors toward green bonds and their appealing nature of diversification has motivated the current research to study the risk connectedness between green and conventional assets spanning from August 2014 to December 2020. We first estimate the dynamic equi-correlations through DECO-GARCH. Next, we assess the dynamic and static risk connectedness in the median, extreme low, and extreme high quantiles arguing that spillovers vary across different time periods particularly during economically intense time periods. Finally, we analyzed the hedge ratio and hedge effectiveness between green bonds and other assets. We find that equi-correlations are intense during economic shocks such as the Shale oil crisis, Brexit, US interest rate hike, and COVID-19 pandemic. The volatility analysis at average, lower, and upper quantiles also validate time-varying attributes of green and conventional assets. Further, network figures of green and conventional assets identify potential diversification opportunities. Meanwhile, the hedge effectiveness indicates that green bonds are effective hedge for precious metals and cryptocurrencies. Our findings draw multiple implications for policymakers, green investors, financial market participants, and regulatory authorities regarding flight-to-safety during crisis times and maintaining a diverse portfolio to escape potential losses.",

        "dc:description": "This paper aims to investigate the current state of play on Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) integration and check the validity of the current metrics system by assessing if it will survive the COVID-19 crisis. By adopting a qualitative research approach through semi-structured anonymous interviews with 14 senior managers of six European listed companies we use a framework by assessing the mechanisms of reactivity on the effectiveness of ESG measures in times of COVID-19. By interpreting the practitioners’ points of view through the lens of the sociological framework by Espeland and Sauder (Am J Sociol 113:1–40, 2007) our findings show different mechanisms of reactivity by companies on the effectiveness of ESG measures in times of COVID-19, i.e., active and passive conformity and active resistance. We also identified the main Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) institutional factors that affect managers’ reactivity. An extensive re-formulation of the ESG metrics is required in the light of times of crisis, given that accountability and transparency are strongly linked to quantitative measures which can play a critical role in the financial system and investors’ engagement. Particularly, the strict distinction between “E”, “S” and “G” issues should be abandoned claiming a different holistic re-design of sustainability measures by considering the increasing relevance of the Social dimension in time of COVID-19. This study provides a valuable contribution to the existing literature on the measurement of sustainability within the link of accountability and crisis by highlighting new corporate needs to re-design the ESG metrics system.",

        "dc:description": "This paper examines the resilience of banks as perceived by market participants during the COVID-19 crisis. We analyse how bank stock returns during January–March 2020 relate to the pre-crisis activation of macroprudential policy across 52 countries in a cross-sectional dimension. We find that, overall, a tighter macroprudential policy stance is beneficial for bank systemic risk, as assessed by equity market investors. A robust finding is that a perceived decrease in bank risk stems primarily from the use of credit growth limits, reserve requirements, and dynamic provisioning. By contrast, a pre-crisis build-up of capital surcharges on systemically important financial institutions seems to lower bank stock returns. Alternative bank risk indicators suggest that the latter is likely to be driven by concerns about profits rather than the probability of default.",

        "dc:description": "Background: This study aims to explain the policies implemented by the European Union in transitioning to a green economy. It examines the period from the adoption of sustainable development within the Union to the present, focusing on the EU's strategies for sustainable development and the green economy. Main text: The study reveals that the European Union has long recognized environmental problems and the impacts of climate change, starting from the 1990s. In response to the global crisis in 2008, the EU embraced the opportunity to build a dynamic, low-carbon, resource-efficient, knowledge-based, and socially inclusive society. Green investments were included in the EU's rescue plan, initiating the green transformation. The study explains the concepts of sustainable development, the green economy, and green growth. It discusses how the European Union implemented its green transformation, particularly through the examination of the European Green Deal. Furthermore, it explores the developments related to climate change and the green economy within the framework of the European 2020 strategy. Conclusions: The findings highlight the European Union's commitment to addressing environmental challenges and transitioning to a green economy. Future research should focus on assessing the effectiveness of implemented policies and strategies in achieving sustainable development goals. The EU allocated a substantial portion of its budget to support green investments, including green incentives during the 2008 financial crisis, and significant budgets from member states like Germany and France. The EU has set ambitious targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, aiming for at least a 40% reduction by 2030 compared to 1990 levels and becoming carbon-neutral by 2050. Future research should also explore the social and economic implications of the green transformation, including job creation and industry competitiveness, to provide valuable insights for policymakers and researchers. This will contribute to enhancing the EU's green policies and advancing the transition to a sustainable and environmentally conscious economy.",

        "dc:description": "This paper investigates the effect of the Russia–Ukraine crisis on the Australian stock market. Using the event study methodology, we find significantly negative abnormal returns on the event date (i.e., the first trading day after Russia recognized the two Ukrainian states as autonomous regions) in the Australian stock market. However, this negative stock market reaction mostly disappeared in the post-event period. We also find that small and medium-sized firms were adversely affected during the pre-event and event periods. Interestingly, the magnitude and the direction of the abnormal returns vary across industries. We also find that high-growth, illiquid and export-oriented firms are more exposed to the Russia–Ukraine crisis.",

        "dc:description": "This paper focuses on social and economic stability, as well as sustainable development, in the post-COVID era in light of the recent theoretical approaches and leadership practices. As governments worldwide resorted to repeated national- and regional-specific impositions of social and economic isolation in an (often failed) attempt to contain the spread of the coronavirus, their economies have been plunged into recessions, which have been deeper than those associated with the global financial crisis in the past. Successful business and economic leaders need to be aware of the dominant trends unfolding as the COVID-19 pandemic is gradually coming to its end and the New Globalization (a new era of international economy and international relations after COVID-19) is materializing. With global living, international travel, and trade interconnected, businesses need to plan for handling the future outbreaks and their economic, as well as social, consequences. The aim of this paper is to draw the lessons for business and economic leaders in the post-COVID era with a focus on the new trends and challenges for the sustainable development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The paper also presents an empirical model that assesses the novel ways of doing business and innovating using the sustainable economic practices after the COVID-19 pandemic. The model employs our own data collected from 450 managers and owners of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the Czech Republic and Russia. Our results show that innovation and digitalization (e.g., smart metering or the Internet of Things (IoT)) are becoming the main drivers of the sustainable economic transformation of small and medium enterprises in the post-pandemic period. These results might be useful for both academic researchers and business practitioners searching for new pathways for innovating their sustainable business practices and recreating their customer base in the post-COVID era.",

        "dc:description": "Across the globe, COVID-19 has disrupted the financial markets, making them more volatile. Thus, this paper examines the market volatility and asymmetric behavior of Bitcoin, EUR, S&P 500 index, Gold, Crude Oil, and Sugar during the COVID-19 pandemic. We applied the GARCH (1, 1), GJR-GARCH (1, 1), and EGARCH (1, 1) econometric models on the daily time series returns data ranging from 27 November 2018 to 15 June 2021. The empirical findings show a high level of volatility persistence in all the financial markets during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, the Crude Oil and S&P 500 index shows significant positive asymmetric behavior during the pandemic. Apart from this, the results also reveal that EGARCH is the most appropriate model to capture the volatilities of the financial markets before the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas during the COVID-19 period and for the whole period, each GARCH family evenly models the volatile behavior of the six financial markets. This study provides financial investors and policymakers with useful insight into adopting effective strategies for constructing portfolios during crises in the future.",

Company's stakeholders are aware of the ethical behavior of those firms related to hazardous activities. Literature has analyzed the relationship between corporate social responsibility and different measures of efficiency (e.g., financial performance or market value) without a conclusive result. This research establishes an ESG index (environmental, social and governance) that allows a comprehensive measure of corporate social responsibility and its effects on corporate financial strategy. The study analyzes how the ESG index influences the value of oil and gas companies as well as their financial performance and financial risk. To do this, the PLS-SEM was applied to a sample of 219 oil and gas companies in different countries. Results show that the environmental and governance dimensions are the backbone of the ESG index that positively impact on all three.",

        "dc:description": "Purpose: Poor corporate governance was reported to significantly contribute to the 2017/2018 financial crisis in Ghana. As leadership is a vital concept in the corporate governance system, this study aims to examine the effect of transformational leadership on organizational performance and hypothesizes that job satisfaction mediates such a relationship. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopted a quantitative research approach where a cross-sectional survey design was used to collect the data from 300 purposively sampled employees of five selected commercial banks. The data was analysed using PROCESS version 3.4.1. Findings: The results show that individualized consideration is the dominant transformational leadership dimension being practiced by supervisors and managers in the selected commercial banks. Again, the four dimensions of transformational leadership have a positive effect on organizational performance, and such effect is significantly mediated by job satisfaction. Practical implications: The findings suggest that the dimensions of transformational leadership should be continuously improved alongside strategically motivating employees to increase their satisfaction level to enhance organizational performance. Originality/value: This study provides evidence that bank managers need to be cognizant that job satisfaction is vital in the industry and must be a focal point of corporate governance practices. The mere initiating of transformational leadership behaviours without a clear link to employee satisfaction may result in employee disengagement, consequently affecting the banks’ performance and survival.",
