        "dc:description": "The number of people suffering from diabetes in Taiwan has continued to rise in recent years. According to the statistics of the International Diabetes Federation, about 537 million people worldwide (10.5% of the global population) suffer from diabetes, and it is estimated that 643 million people will develop the condition (11.3% of the total population) by 2030. If this trend continues, the number will jump to 783 million (12.2%) by 2045. At present, the number of people with diabetes in Taiwan has reached 2.18 million, with an average of one in ten people suffering from the disease. In addition, according to the Bureau of National Health Insurance in Taiwan, the prevalence rate of diabetes among adults in Taiwan has reached 5% and is increasing each year. Diabetes can cause acute and chronic complications that can be fatal. Meanwhile, chronic complications can result in a variety of disabilities or organ decline. If holistic treatments and preventions are not provided to diabetic patients, it will lead to the consumption of more medical resources and a rapid decline in the quality of life of society as a whole. In this study, based on the outpatient examination data of a Taipei Municipal medical center, 15,000 women aged between 20 and 80 were selected as the subjects. These women were patients who had gone to the medical center during 2018–2020 and 2021–2022 with or without the diagnosis of diabetes. This study investigated eight different characteristics of the subjects, including the number of pregnancies, plasma glucose level, diastolic blood pressure, sebum thickness, insulin level, body mass index, diabetes pedigree function, and age. After sorting out the complete data of the patients, this study used Microsoft Machine Learning Studio to train the models of various kinds of neural networks, and the prediction results were used to compare the predictive ability of the various parameters for diabetes. Finally, this study found that after comparing the models using two-class logistic regression as well as the two-class neural network, two-class decision jungle, or two-class boosted decision tree for prediction, the best model was the two-class boosted decision tree, as its area under the curve could reach a score of 0.991, which was better than other models.",

The aim of this review is to examine the challenges and potential solutions for the implementation and evaluation of digital health technologies. Digital tools are used across the world in different settings. In Australia, the Digital Health Translation and Implementation Program (DHTI) emphasizes the importance of involving stakeholders and addressing infrastructure and training issues for healthcare workers. The WHO's Global Task Force on Digital Health for TB aims to address tuberculosis through digital health innovations. Digital tools are also used in mental health care, but their effectiveness must be evaluated during development. Oncology supportive care uses digital tools for cancer patient intervention and surveillance, but evaluating their effectiveness can be challenging. In the COVID and post-COVID era, digital health solutions must be evaluated based on their technological maturity and size of deployment, as well as the quality of data they provide. To safely and effectively use digital healthcare technology, it is essential to prioritize evaluation using complex systems and evidence-based medical frameworks. To address the challenges of digital health implementation, it is important to prioritize ethical research addressing issues of user consent and addressing socioeconomic disparities in access and effectiveness. It is also important to consider the impact of digital health on health outcomes and the cost-effectiveness of service delivery.",

        "dc:description": "In the context of simulation-based optimisation, this paper reviews recent work related to the role of metaheuristics, matheuristics (combinations of exact optimisation methods with metaheuristics), simheuristics (hybridisation of simulation with metaheuristics), biased-randomised heuristics for ‘agile’ optimisation via parallel computing, and learnheuristics (combination of statistical/machine learning with metaheuristics) to deal with NP-hard and large-scale optimisation problems in areas such as transport and logistics, manufacturing and production, smart cities, telecommunication networks, finance and insurance, sustainable energy consumption, health care, military and defence, e-marketing, or bioinformatics. The manuscript provides the main related concepts and updated references that illustrate the applications of these hybrid optimisation–simulation–learning approaches in solving rich and real-life challenges under dynamic and uncertainty scenarios. A numerical analysis is also included to illustrate the benefits that these approaches can offer across different application fields. Finally, this work concludes by highlighting open research lines on the combination of these methodologies to extend the concept of simulation-based optimisation.",

        "dc:description": "Modern endoscopy relies on digital technology, from high-resolution imaging sensors and displays to electronics connecting configurable illumination and actuation systems for robotic articulation. In addition to enabling more effective diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, the digitization of the procedural toolset enables video data capture of the internal human anatomy at unprecedented levels. Interventional video data encapsulate functional and structural information about a patient’s anatomy as well as events, activity and action logs about the surgical process. This detailed but difficult-to-interpret record from endoscopic procedures can be linked to preoperative and postoperative records or patient imaging information. Rapid advances in artificial intelligence, especially in supervised deep learning, can utilize data from endoscopic procedures to develop systems for assisting procedures leading to computer-assisted interventions that can enable better navigation during procedures, automation of image interpretation and robotically assisted tool manipulation. In this Perspective, we summarize state-of-the-art artificial intelligence for computer-assisted interventions in gastroenterology and surgery.",

        "dc:description": "With the worldwide digitalisation of medical records, electronic health records (EHRs) have become an increasingly important source of real-world data (RWD). RWD can complement traditional study designs because it captures almost the complete variety of patients, leading to more generalisable results. For rheumatology, these data are particularly interesting as our diseases are uncommon and often take years to develop. In this review, we discuss the following concepts related to the use of EHR for research and considerations for translation into clinical care: EHR data contain a broad collection of healthcare data covering the multitude of real-life patients and the healthcare processes related to their care. Machine learning (ML) is a powerful method that allows us to leverage a large amount of heterogeneous clinical data for clinical algorithms, but requires extensive training, testing, and validation. Patterns discovered in EHR data using ML are applicable to real life settings, however, are also prone to capturing the local EHR structure and limiting generalisability outside the EHR(s) from which they were developed. Population studies on EHR necessitates knowledge on the factors influencing the data available in the EHR to circumvent biases, for example, access to medical care, insurance status. In summary, EHR data represent a rapidly growing and key resource for real-world studies. However, transforming RWD EHR data for research and for real-world evidence using ML requires knowledge of the EHR system and their differences from existing observational data to ensure that studies incorporate rigorous methods that acknowledge or address factors such as access to care, noise in the data, missingness and indication bias.",

        "dc:description": "Shared decision-making is increasingly embraced in health care and recommended in cardiovascular guidelines. Patient involvement in health care decisions, patient-clinician communication, and models of patient-centered care are critical to improve health outcomes and to promote equity, but formal models and evaluation in cardiovascular care are nascent. Shared decision-making promotes equity by involving clinicians and patients, sharing the best available evidence, and recognizing the needs, values, and experiences of individuals and their families when faced with the task of making decisions. Broad endorsement of shared decision-making as a critical component of high-quality, value-based care has raised our awareness, although uptake in clinical practice remains suboptimal for a range of patient, clinician, and system issues. Strategies effective in promoting shared decision-making include educating clinicians on communication techniques, engaging multidisciplinary medical teams, incorporating trained decision coaches, and using tools (ie, patient decision aids) at appropriate literacy and numeracy levels to support patients in their cardiovascular decisions. This scientific statement shines a light on the limited but growing body of evidence of the impact of shared decision-making on cardiovascular outcomes and the potential of shared decision-making as a driver of health equity so that everyone has just opportunities. Multilevel solutions must align to address challenges in policies and reimbursement, system-level leadership and infrastructure, clinician training, access to decision aids, and patient engagement to fully support patients and clinicians to engage in the shared decision-making process and to drive equity and improvement in cardiovascular outcomes.",

        "dc:description": "Using the wrong metrics to gauge classification of highly imbalanced Big Data may hide important information in experimental results. However, we find that analysis of metrics for performance evaluation and what they can hide or reveal is rarely covered in related works. Therefore, we address that gap by analyzing multiple popular performance metrics on three Big Data classification tasks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to utilize three new Medicare insurance claims datasets which became publicly available in 2021. These datasets are all highly imbalanced. Furthermore, the datasets are comprised of completely different data. We evaluate the performance of five ensemble learners in the Machine Learning task of Medicare fraud detection. Random Undersampling (RUS) is applied to induce five class ratios. The classifiers are evaluated with both the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC), and Area Under the Precision Recall Curve (AUPRC) metrics. We show that AUPRC provides a better insight into classification performance. Our findings reveal that the AUC metric hides the performance impact of RUS. However, classification results in terms of AUPRC show RUS has a detrimental effect. We show that, for highly imbalanced Big Data, the AUC metric fails to capture information about precision scores and false positive counts that the AUPRC metric reveals. Our contribution is to show AUPRC is a more effective metric for evaluating the performance of classifiers when working with highly imbalanced Big Data.",

        "dc:description": "Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) and XGBoost are widely used in insurance risk pricing and claims prediction, with GLMs dominant in the insurance industry. The increasing prevalence of connected car data usage in insurance requires highly accurate and interpretable models. Deep learning (DL) models have outperformed traditional Machine Learning (ML) models in multiple domains; despite this, they are underutilized in insurance risk pricing. This study introduces an alternative DL architecture, TabNet, suitable for insurance telematics datasets and claim prediction. This approach compares the TabNet DL model against XGBoost and Logistic Regression on the task of claim prediction on a synthetic telematics dataset. TabNet outperformed these models, providing highly interpretable results and capturing the sparsity of the claims data with high accuracy. However, TabNet requires considerable running time and effort in hyperparameter tuning to achieve these results. Despite these limitations, TabNet provides better pricing models for interpretable models in insurance when compared to XGBoost and Logistic Regression models.",

The health status of each individual is being monitored irrespective of his/her medical conditions. The advent of such medical devices is beneficial not only for patients but also for physicians, hospitals, and insurance companies. It makes healthcare fast, reliable, and hassle-free. People can keep an eye on their blood pressure, pulse rate, etc., and thus take preventive measures on their own. In hospitals, too, the Internet of Things (IoT) is being deployed for various tasks such as monitoring oxygen and blood sugar levels, electrocardiograms (ECGs), etc. The IoT in healthcare also reduces the cost of various ailments through fast and rigorous data analysis. The prediction of diseases through machine-learning techniques based on symptoms has become a promising concept. There may also be a situation where real-time analysis is required. In such a latency-sensitive situation, fog computing plays a vital role. Establishing communication every time with the cloud is not required with the introduction of fog and thus the latency is reduced. Healthcare is a latency-sensitive application area. So, the deployment of fog computing in this area is of vital importance. Our work focuses on improving the efficiency of the system for the precise diagnosis of and recommendations for heart disease. It evaluates the system using a machine-learning module.",

        "dc:description": "Predicting crop yield before harvest and understanding the factors determining yield at a regional scale is vital for global food security, supply chain management in agribusiness, crop and insurance pricing and optimising crop production. Often satellite remote sensing data, environmental data or their combinations are used to model crop yield at a regional scale. However, their contribution, including that of recently developed remote sensing data like solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) and near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv), are not explored sufficiently. This study aims to assess the contribution of weather, soil and remote sensing data to estimate wheat yield prediction at a regional scale. For this, we employed four types of remote sensing data, thirteen climatic variables, four soil variables, and nationwide yield data of 14 years combined with statistical learning methods to predict winter wheat yield in the Conterminous United States (CONUS) and access the role of predicting variables. Machine-learning algorithms were used to build yield prediction models in different experimental settings, and predictive performance was evaluated. Further, the relative importance of predictor variables for the models was assessed to gain insight into the model's behaviour. NIRv and SIF data are found to be promising for crop yield prediction. The model with only NIRv data explained up to 64% of the variability in yield, and adding SIF data improved it to 69%. We also found that vegetation indices, SIF, climate and soil data all contribute unique and overlapping information to crop yield prediction. The study also identified important variables and the time of the growing period when these variables have higher explanatory power for winter wheat yield prediction. This study enhanced our knowledge of yield-predicting variables, which will contribute to optimising the yield and developing better yield prediction models.",

        "dc:description": "Background: Data drift can negatively impact the performance of machine learning algorithms (MLAs) that were trained on historical data. As such, MLAs should be continuously monitored and tuned to overcome the systematic changes that occur in the distribution of data. In this paper, we study the extent of data drift and provide insights about its characteristics for sepsis onset prediction. This study will help elucidate the nature of data drift for prediction of sepsis and similar diseases. This may aid with the development of more effective patient monitoring systems that can stratify risk for dynamic disease states in hospitals. Methods: We devise a series of simulations that measure the effects of data drift in patients with sepsis, using electronic health records (EHR). We simulate multiple scenarios in which data drift may occur, namely the change in the distribution of the predictor variables (covariate shift), the change in the statistical relationship between the predictors and the target (concept shift), and the occurrence of a major healthcare event (major event) such as the COVID-19 pandemic. We measure the impact of data drift on model performances, identify the circumstances that necessitate model retraining, and compare the effects of different retraining methodologies and model architecture on the outcomes. We present the results for two different MLAs, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Results: Our results show that the properly retrained XGB models outperform the baseline models in all simulation scenarios, hence signifying the existence of data drift. In the major event scenario, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) at the end of the simulation period is 0.811 for the baseline XGB model and 0.868 for the retrained XGB model. In the covariate shift scenario, the AUROC at the end of the simulation period for the baseline and retrained XGB models is 0.853 and 0.874 respectively. In the concept shift scenario and under the mixed labeling method, the retrained XGB models perform worse than the baseline model for most simulation steps. However, under the full relabeling method, the AUROC at the end of the simulation period for the baseline and retrained XGB models is 0.852 and 0.877 respectively. The results for the RNN models were mixed, suggesting that retraining based on a fixed network architecture may be inadequate for an RNN. We also present the results in the form of other performance metrics such as the ratio of observed to expected probabilities (calibration) and the normalized rate of positive predictive values (PPV) by prevalence, referred to as lift, at a sensitivity of 0.8. Conclusion: Our simulations reveal that retraining periods of a couple of months or using several thousand patients are likely to be adequate to monitor machine learning models that predict sepsis. This indicates that a machine learning system for sepsis prediction will probably need less infrastructure for performance monitoring and retraining compared to other applications in which data drift is more frequent and continuous. Our results also show that in the event of a concept shift, a full overhaul of the sepsis prediction model may be necessary because it indicates a discrete change in the definition of sepsis labels, and mixing the labels for the sake of incremental training may not produce the desired results.",

        "dc:description": "The study’s goal is to analyse and predict customer reviews of insurance products using various machine learning techniques. We gathered consumer rating data from the Yelp website and filtered the initial data set to only include insurance reviews. Following cleaning, the filtered summary texts were graded as positive, neutral or negative sentiments, and the AFINN and Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning (VADER) sentiment algorithms were used to rate those sentiments. Furthermore, the current investigation employs five supervised machine learning approaches to divide customer ratings of insurance companies into three sentiment groups. The results of the current study revealed that the majority of customer reviews for the insurance products were negative, with the average number of words with negative sentiment being higher. In addition, current research discovered that while all of the approaches (decision tree, K Neighbours classifier, support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression and random forest classifier) can correctly classify review text into sentiment class, logistic regression outperforms in high accuracy. We analysed and predicted customer review messages using a variety of machine learning methods, which could help companies better understand how customers respond to their products and services. As a result, companies can learn how to use machine learning methods to better understand the behaviour of their customers.",

        "dc:description": "Purpose: To analyze a recently published chest radiography foundation model for the presence of biases that could lead to subgroup performance disparities across biologic sex and race. Materials and Methods: This Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act–compliant retrospective study used 127 118 chest radiographs from 42 884 patients (mean age, 63 years ± 17 [SD]; 23 623 male, 19 261 female) from the CheXpert dataset that were collected between October 2002 and July 2017. To determine the presence of bias in features generated by a chest radiography foundation model and baseline deep learning model, dimensionality reduction methods together with two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests were used to detect distribution shifts across sex and race. A comprehensive disease detection performance analysis was then performed to associate any biases in the features to specific disparities in classification performance across patient subgroups. Results: Ten of 12 pairwise comparisons across biologic sex and race showed statistically significant differences in the studied foundation model, compared with four significant tests in the baseline model. Significant differences were found between male and female (P <.001) and Asian and Black (P <.001) patients in the feature projections that primarily capture disease. Compared with average model performance across all subgroups, classification performance on the “no finding” label decreased between 6.8% and 7.8% for female patients, and performance in detecting “pleural effusion” decreased between 10.7% and 11.6% for Black patients. Conclusion: The studied chest radiography foundation model demonstrated racial and sex-related bias, which led to disparate perfmance across patient subgroups; thus, this model may be unsafe for clinical applications.",

        "dc:description": "The Reinforced Concrete (RC) buildings in countries within earthquake zones like Turkey are generally damaged more than anticipated during earthquakes. Corrosion of reinforcement and other damages caused by the corrosion are also widely encountered in relatively old structures that have not received adequate engineering services. Although it is not easy to differentiate the earthquake and corrosion damages in some cases, the formation mechanisms of these damages and their consequences in terms of structural safety may be quite different. For this reason, in post-earthquake damage detections, it is important to determine the cause of the damage in a realistic way to plan the future interventions on the building (repair methodology, demolition / reconstruction, etc.) properly and to accurately decide on the financial schemes for required interventions (insurance, government support, owner, etc.). In this sense, smart systems are needed to be activated to speed up the decision-making process of the engineers/technical staff to be involved in field damage assessment surveys after earthquakes. Based on this motivation, a Deep Transfer Learning algorithm was developed in this study, which allowed distinguishing of damages caused by corrosion from earthquake-induced damages in structural elements of RC buildings. This study, which was conducted for the first time in the literature, tested the performance of Deep Transfer Learning method in damage detection and classification efforts of RC structural members. For development of the algorithm, a data pool was used consisting of images belonging to 1040 damaged RC elements, mostly columns, obtained from field surveys conducted after İstanbul-Silivri (Mw = 5.8) earthquake dated 26.09.2019 and Elazığ-Sivrice (Mw = 6.8) earthquake dated 24.01.2020. The developed algorithm can determine whether the damage was caused by earthquake or reinforcement corrosion with an estimate success of 90.62 % based on damage image. Additionally, at the end of the study, classification performance of developed algorithm was also tested by using different data pool from Samos Earthquake dated 30.10.2020 (Mw = 6.6). It has been seen that the algorithm makes damage type predictions with high success in the new data set.",

Unlike conventional therapeutics, digital therapeutics deliver interventions directly to patients using an evidence-based, clinically evaluated software to treat, manage, or prevent diseases. Digital therapeutics manifest in diverse forms such as web-based applications, mobile applications on smart devices, virtual reality, and video games. As its own product category for FDA approval, digital therapeutics can function as stand-alone treatments or in combination with conventional therapeutics to improve adherence and/or efficacy. Here, we review the clinical landscape of digital therapeutics. We summarize FDA-approved products and their clinical use, overview >300 ongoing clinical trials, and discuss challenges for their clinical translation and strategies to overcome the same.",

        "dc:description": "As healthcare data becomes increasingly available from various sources, including clinical institutions, patients, insurance companies, and pharmaceutical industries, machine learning (ML) services are becoming more significant in healthcare-facing domains. Therefore, it is imperative to ensure the integrity and reliability of ML models to maintain the quality of healthcare services. Particularly due to the growing need for privacy and security, healthcare data has resulted in each Internet of Things (IoT) device being treated as an independent source of data, isolated from other devices. Moreover, the limited computational and communication capabilities of wearable healthcare devices hinder the applicability of traditional ML. Federated Learning (FL) is a paradigm that maintains data privacy by storing only learned models on a server and advances with data from scattered clients, making it ideal for healthcare applications where patient data must be safeguarded. The potential of FL to transform healthcare is significant, as it can enable the development of new ML-powered applications that can enhance the quality of care, lower costs, and improve patient outcomes. However, the accuracy of current Federated Learning aggregation methods suffers greatly in unstable network situations due to the high volume of weights transmitted and received. To address this issue, we propose an alternative approach to Federated Average (FedAvg) that updates the global model by gathering score values from learned models primarily utilized in Federated Learning, using an improved version of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) called FedImpPSO. This approach boosts the robustness of the algorithm in erratic network conditions. To further enhance the speed and efficiency of data exchange within a network, we modify the format of the data clients send to servers using the FedImpPSO method. The proposed approach is evaluated using the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). We found that it yielded an average accuracy improvement of 8.14% over FedAvg and 2.5% over Federated PSO (FedPSO). This study evaluates the use of FedImpPSO in healthcare by training a deep-learning model over two case studies to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach in healthcare. The first case study involves the classification of COVID-19 using public datasets (Ultrasound and X-ray) and achieved an F1-measure of 77.90% and 92.16%, respectively. The second case study was conducted over the cardiovascular dataset, where our proposed FedImpPSO achieves 91.18% and 92% accuracy in predicting the existence of heart diseases. As a result, our approach demonstrates the effectiveness of using FedImpPSO to improve the accuracy and robustness of Federated Learning in unstable network conditions and has potential applications in healthcare and other domains where data privacy is critical.",

        "dc:description": "Fraud is a significant issue for insurance companies, generating much interest in machine learning solutions. Although supervised learning for insurance fraud detection has long been a research focus, unsupervised learning has rarely been studied in this context, and there remains insufficient evidence to guide the choice between these branches of machine learning for insurance fraud detection. Accordingly, this study evaluates supervised and unsupervised learning using proprietary insurance claim data. Furthermore, we conduct a field experiment in cooperation with an insurance company to investigate the performance of each approach in terms of identifying new fraudulent claims. We derive several important findings. Unsupervised learning, especially isolation forests, can successfully detect insurance fraud. Supervised learning also performs strongly, despite few labeled fraud cases. Interestingly, unsupervised and supervised learning detect new fraudulent claims based on different input information. Therefore, for implementation, we suggest understanding supervised and unsupervised methods as complements rather than substitutes.",

        "dc:description": "Intelligent transportation systems require efficient ways to manage traffic incidents like accidents and traffic rule violations. Secure logging of incident related data is important in case of accidents for forensic analysis, insurance, and legal settlements. Internet of vehicles can be enhanced using machine learning techniques to detect events automatically at the vehicle and road infrastructure level and blockchain can be used as a source for immutable evidence storage and management. The work proposes a framework addressing multiple challenges in traffic incident detection and evidence management like gathering of traffic event related evidence from multiple sources, addressing fault management in embedded vehicle on board units, resiliency from malicious event reporting and handling conflicting traffic incident event reports. The framework relies on a combination of cooperative event correlation and trust model to detect malicious and erroneous reporting of traffic incidents followed by Long Short term Memory (LSTM) and Bayesian model to resolve conflicting event reports. The events are correlated and verified before being transmitting onto the blockchain for evidence management and access control by various stakeholders. Analysis is presented highlighting the improvement in efficiency achieved by convergence of the multiple approaches proposed.",

Recent Findings: Generative AI is a powerful technology that is changing rapidly. As psychiatrists, it is important for us to understand generative AI technology and how it may impact our patients and our practice of medicine. Summary: This paper aims to build this understanding by focusing on GPT-4 and its potential impact on mental health care delivery. We first introduce key concepts and terminology describing how the technology works and various novel uses of it. We then dive into key considerations for GPT-4 and other large language models (LLMs) and wrap up with suggested future directions and initial guidance to the field.",

        "dc:description": "Background: Increasingly, patient medication adherence data are being consolidated from claims databases and electronic health records (EHRs). Such databases offer an indirect avenue to gauge medication adherence in our data-rich healthcare milieu. The surge in data accessibility, coupled with the pressing need for its conversion to actionable insights, has spotlighted data mining, with machine learning (ML) emerging as a pivotal technique. Nonadherence poses heightened health risks and escalates medical costs. This paper elucidates the synergistic interaction between medical database mining for medication adherence and the role of ML in fostering knowledge discovery. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive review of EHR applications in the realm of medication adherence, leveraging ML techniques. We expounded on the evolution and structure of medical databases pertinent to medication adherence and harnessed both supervised and unsupervised ML paradigms to delve into adherence and its ramifications. Results: Our study underscores the applications of medical databases and ML, encompassing both supervised and unsupervised learning, for medication adherence in clinical big data. Databases like SEER and NHANES, often underutilized due to their intricacies, have gained prominence. Employing ML to excavate patient medication logs from these databases facilitates adherence analysis. Such findings are pivotal for clinical decision-making, risk stratification, and scholarly pursuits, aiming to elevate healthcare quality. Conclusion: Advanced data mining in the era of big data has revolutionized medication adherence research, thereby enhancing patient care. Emphasizing bespoke interventions and research could herald transformative shifts in therapeutic modalities.",

        "dc:description": "Background: COVID-19 in pregnant people increases the risk for poor maternal–fetal outcomes. However, COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy remains due to concerns over the vaccine's potential effects on maternal–fetal outcomes. Here we examine the impact of COVID-19 vaccination and boosters on maternal SARS-CoV-2 infections and birth outcomes. Methods: This was a retrospective multicentre cohort study on the impact of COVID-19 vaccination on maternal–fetal outcomes for people who delivered (n=106 428) at Providence St Joseph Health across seven western US states from Jan 26, 2021 to Oct 26, 2022. Cohorts were defined by vaccination status at delivery: vaccinated (n=35 926; two or more doses of mRNA-1273 Moderna or BNT162b2 Pfizer–BioNTech), unvaccinated (n=55 878), unvaccinated propensity score matched (n=16 771), boosted (n=10 927; three or more doses), vaccinated unboosted (n=13 243; two doses only), and vaccinated unboosted with propensity score matching (n=4414). We built supervised machine learning classification models, which we used to determine which people were more likely to be vaccinated or boosted at delivery. The primary outcome was maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection. COVID-19 vaccination status at delivery, COVID-19-related health care, preterm birth, stillbirth, and very low birthweight were evaluated as secondary outcomes. Findings: Vaccinated people were more likely to conceive later in the pandemic, have commercial insurance, be older, live in areas with lower household composition vulnerability, and have a higher BMI than unvaccinated people. Boosted people were more likely to have more days since receiving the second COVID-19 vaccine dose, conceive earlier in the pandemic, have commercial insurance, be older, and live in areas with lower household composition vulnerability than vaccinated unboosted people. Vaccinated pregnant people had lower rates of COVID-19 during pregnancy (4·0%) compared with unvaccinated matched people (5·3%; p<0·0001). COVID-19 rates were even lower in boosted people (3·2%) compared with vaccinated unboosted matched people (5·6%; p<0·0001). Vaccinated people were also less likely to have a preterm birth (7·9%; p<0·0001), stillbirth (0·3%; p<0·0002), or very low birthweight neonate (1·0%; p<0·0001) compared with unvaccinated matched people (preterm birth 9·4%; stillbirth 0·6%; very low birthweight 1·5%). Boosted people were less likely to have a stillbirth (0·3%; p<0·025) and have no differences in rates of preterm birth (7·6%; p=0·090) or very low birthweight neonates (0·8%; p=0·092) compared with vaccinated unboosted matched people (stillbirth 0·5%; preterm birth 8·4%; very low birthweight 1·1%). Interpretation: COVID-19 vaccination protects against adverse maternal–fetal outcomes, with booster doses conferring additional protection. Pregnant people should be high priority for vaccination and stay up to date with their COVID-19 vaccination schedule.
